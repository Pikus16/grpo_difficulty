Start with:  \n   `( [ < < { } > > ]`\n\n2. Break down the brackets that are currently **opened** (not yet closed):\n\n   - First: `<` (1st)\n   - Second: `<` (2nd)\n   - Third: `{` (next)\n   - Fourth: `}` (closing the `{`)\n   - Fifth: `>` (closing the 2nd `<`)\n   - Sixth: `>` (closing the 1st `<`)\n   - Seventh: `]` (closing the `[`)\n\nSo, what brackets are **still open** at the end of the input?\n\n- The first `<` (1st) was opened.\n- The second `<` (2nd) was opened.\n- The `{` was opened, and then closed.\n- The `[` was opened, and then closed.\n\nSo, the brackets still **open** are:\n- The **second** `<`"]]
