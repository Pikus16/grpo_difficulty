Let's find the unpaired brackets:\n\n1. The last closing bracket is `)`, which is a closing parenthesis, but it is not properly matched.\n2.

We'll look for **unclosed brackets**, and **add the missing closing brackets** in the correct order.\n\n### Step 2: Use Stack-Based Approach\nWe can simulate a **stack-based approach** to find the unclosed brackets:\n\nWe'll iterate through the string and use a **stack** to track the opening brackets. Each time we see an opening bracket (i.e., '(', ')', '{', '}', '<', '>', '[', ']'), we push it onto the stack. When we see a closing bracket, we pop the top of the stack if it matches the corresponding opening bracket. If not, we add a missing closing bracket.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate this with the input string.\n\nLet\u2019s", "user\nYou are an expert in a language called dyck where you must complete the language sequence of unclosed brackets of all types (e.g., [], {}, <>).Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.

For each character in the sequence:\n   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., [ ( { <), push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., ] ) } >), check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If yes, pop it. If not, it's an error.\n3.

The goal is to complete the sequence so that all brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\nLet's break down the task step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the open brackets**: Every time we see an opening bracket `[`, `{`, or `<`, we need to find the corresponding closing bracket `]`, `}`, or `>`.\n\n2. **Use a stack** to keep track of the opening brackets. For every opening bracket, push it onto the stack. For every closing bracket, pop the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket.\n\n3. **If there are any unmatched open brackets remaining**, they must be closed in the reverse order they were pushed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided input:\n\n```plaintext\n[ < < [ [ ] ( ) { < > ( [ { } { < > } { } ] ) } [ [ [ ( [ ( ) [ [ { < [ { { } } < { { < ( ) > } } > ] > } ] ] ] ) ] < < [ [ ( < < ( ) > > ) ] ] > > [ ] ] ] ] <", "user\nYou are an expert in a language called dyck where you must complete the language sequence of unclosed brackets of all types (e.g., [], {}, <>).Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.

The goal is to **close all unclosed brackets** in the correct order.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify Unclosed Brackets\n\nWe can simulate a **stack-based approach**, where we push opening brackets onto the stack and pop when a corresponding closing bracket is found.
