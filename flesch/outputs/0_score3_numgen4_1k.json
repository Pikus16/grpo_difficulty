This energy is like a special kind of fuel that powers their growth.\n\n**Step 3: Plants make food (glucose) and oxygen**\nUsing the energy from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, plants create a type of sugar called glucose. This is their food. They also release oxygen into the air as a byproduct.\n\n**Step 4: Plants use glucose for growth**\nThe glucose that plants make is used to grow leaves, stems, roots, and flowers. It's like a special kind of food that gives them energy to live.\n\n**Step 5: Oxygen is released into the air**\nThe oxygen that plants release into the air is what we breathe in to stay alive.
