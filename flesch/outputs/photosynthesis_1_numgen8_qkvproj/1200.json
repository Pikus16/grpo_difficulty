Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Plants spread out their leaves** to catch the sun's light.\n2. They take in a gas called **carbon dioxide** from the air.\n3. They also take in **water** from the ground through their roots.\n4. They use the sun's **light energy** to turn the water and carbon dioxide into a type of sugar.\n5. The sugar is the plant's food.<|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|>"]}
