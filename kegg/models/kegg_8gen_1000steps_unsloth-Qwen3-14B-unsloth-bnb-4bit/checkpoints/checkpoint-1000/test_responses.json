Mutations in PSEN1 are strongly associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). These mutations disrupt normal proteolytic processing of APP, leading to increased production of toxic amyloid-beta 42, which accumulates in the brain, forming plaques. This contributes to neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. The pathway involves PSEN1 activating GSK3B, which phosphorylates tau, promoting neurofibrillary tangles. Interaction with KIF5 and KLC proteins may regulate intracellular trafficking of amyloidogenic substrates.
