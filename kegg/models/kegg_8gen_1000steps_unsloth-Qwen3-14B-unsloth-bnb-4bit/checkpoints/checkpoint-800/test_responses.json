Mutations or loss of CDKN2A function disrupt this inhibition, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. This disruption is implicated in the development of melanoma, a highly aggressive skin cancer. CDKN2A mutations are frequently observed in familial melanoma syndromes and contribute to sporadic melanoma as well. The pathway described involves interactions with TP53, MDM2, CDKN1A, and the E2F/RB1 network, all of which are central to cell cycle control and apoptosis.
