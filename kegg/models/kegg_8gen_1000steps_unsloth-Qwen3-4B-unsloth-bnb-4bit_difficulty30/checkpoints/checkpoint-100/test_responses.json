Mutations in the TARDBP gene have been associated with familial ALS, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to loss of voluntary muscle control. TARDBP plays a role in RNA metabolism and stress granule formation, and its dysfunction can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and neuronal death. Variants in the TARDBP gene have been linked to both familial and sporadic forms of ALS.

Mutations in the SOD1 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. These mutations lead to the misfolding and aggregation of SOD1 protein, which can disrupt cellular function and contribute to neuronal death. Additionally, SOD1 mutations can lead to the formation of toxic protein aggregates that interfere with mitochondrial function and increase oxidative stress. The SOD1 pathway also interacts with the proteasome system, which is involved in protein degradation and clearance of misfolded proteins. Defects in this pathway can contribute to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, further promoting neurodegeneration.

This promotes oncogenic transformation and is associated with various cancers, including melanoma, glioblastoma, and certain leukemias. CDKN2A also acts as a negative regulator of MDM2, which in turn regulates TP53. Loss of CDKN2A can lead to increased MDM2 activity, reducing TP53 function, which is critical for DNA repair and apoptosis. This loss of function contributes to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. The CDKN2A allele is a key genetic factor in the development of several cancers, particularly those involving dysregulation of the cell cycle and DNA repair. \n\n\\boxed{Melanoma}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Loss of CDKN2A function can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation. This allele contributes to various cancers, particularly **retinoblastoma** and **melanoma**. CDKN2A is also involved in the **p53-CDK4/6-RB pathway**, which regulates cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Defective CDKN2A can lead to impaired p53 function and increased RB1 activity, promoting cellular transformation. Mutations in CDKN2A are commonly found in **pancreatic cancer**, **lung cancer**, and **glioblastoma**. It is also associated with **Li-Fraumeni syndrome**, a genetic disorder that increases cancer risk. Thus, the CDKN2A allele contributes to multiple cancers by disrupting cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. \n\n\\boxed{Cancer}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Loss of CDKN2A function leads to unchecked cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1 phase. This contributes to uncontrolled cell proliferation and is associated with various cancers. CDKN2A mutations are commonly found in melanoma, where they disrupt the CDK4/6-RB1-E2F pathway, leading to E2F activation and transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression. Additionally, CDKN2A loss can activate MDM2, which stabilizes p53 and promotes apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. However, in the absence of functional p53, this can lead to tumorigenesis. CDKN2A's loss is also implicated in other cancers such as bladder cancer, brain tumors, and certain leukemias. Therefore, the CDKN2A allele contributes to the development of **melanoma**. \n\n\\boxed{melanoma}"]]
