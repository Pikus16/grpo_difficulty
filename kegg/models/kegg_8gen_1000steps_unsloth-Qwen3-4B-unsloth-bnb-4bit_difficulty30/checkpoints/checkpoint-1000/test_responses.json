Mutations in TARDBP are associated with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by stiffness, loss of balance, and cognitive decline. The protein also plays a role in the formation of the ubiquitin-like protein, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Variants in TARDBP have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases, including PSP and, less commonly, frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Mutations in PRKN are associated with PARK2 gene mutations, which cause **Parkinson\u2019s disease**. The pathway described involves PRKN activating PLCG1, leading to IP3 production, which releases Ca\u00b2\u207a via ITPR receptors. This Ca\u00b2\u207a signaling is critical for mitochondrial function and neuroprotection. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, disrupted PRKN function impairs mitochondrial autophagy and increases oxidative stress, leading to neuronal death. The accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein and mitochondrial dysfunction are key features of the disease.

Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell cycle progression. In the context of the provided pathway, CDKN2A's inactivation can result in the activation of MDM2, which stabilizes p53. This can lead to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. However, if p53 is also inactivated (e.g., by mutations), the cell cycle may proceed unchecked. The loss of CDKN2A is associated with the development of various cancers, most notably **melanoma**. Additionally, CDKN2A loss can contribute to **pancreatic cancer** and **non-small cell lung cancer** by promoting cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Therefore, the biological effect of a loss-of-function CDKN2A allele is **melanoma**.\n\n\\boxed{melanoma}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell cycle progression. This allele is associated with several cancers, including **melanoma**, **pancreatic cancer**, and **sarcomas**. CDKN2A also interacts with MDM2 and TP53, which regulate the G1/S checkpoint. Loss of CDKN2A can lead to the activation of E2F transcription factors, promoting cell proliferation and contributing to tumorigenesis. Additionally, CDKN2A's loss can result in the inactivation of RB1, further promoting cell cycle progression. These effects make CDKN2A a key player in the development of **melanoma** and other cancers. \n\n\\boxed{Melanoma}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell cycle progression. This contributes to various cancers, particularly melanoma. CDKN2A also encodes p14, which inhibits MDM2, a regulator of p53. Loss of CDKN2A can lead to increased MDM2 activity, reducing p53 function, which is critical for DNA repair and apoptosis. This dysregulation promotes genomic instability and tumorigenesis. In the context of the given pathway, CDKN2A loss disrupts the CDK4/6-RB1-E2F pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest failure and unchecked proliferation. This is a key driver in the development of melanoma and other cancers. The biological effect of the CDKN2A allele is the promotion of cancer, particularly melanoma.\n\n\\boxed{Melanoma}"]]
