Mutations in the *TARDBP* gene are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The gene is part of the pathway that includes several mitochondrial complex I subunits, which are involved in cellular respiration. While the pathway includes many genes related to mitochondrial function, the key contributor to disease in this context is *TARDBP*. Mutations in *TARDBP* are linked to familial ALS, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons.

Mutations in the TARDBP gene are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease. The protein is a key component of the RNA-processing complex known as the RNA granules, which are involved in stabilizing mRNA and regulating protein synthesis. In ALS, dysfunction of TARDBP can lead to the misfolding and aggregation of proteins, contributing to neuronal degeneration.

Mutations in PSEN1 are a known genetic cause of early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. The PSEN1 protein is part of the gamma-secretase complex, which is involved in the processing of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). Mutations in PSEN1 lead to increased production of amyloid-beta peptides, which aggregate to form plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, PSEN1 is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, and disruptions in this pathway can contribute to neurodegeneration. The pathway described is involved in mitochondrial calcium handling, which is critical for neuronal function and survival. Aberrant calcium signaling, as seen in this pathway, is implicated in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Specifically, loss-of-function mutations in KCNC3 are associated with **long QT syndrome**, a condition that affects heart rhythm and can lead to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Additionally, KCNC3 has been linked to **Eagle syndrome**, a rare condition affecting the throat and neck, though this is less commonly associated with genetic mutations.

The pathway described involves APP leading to Abeta, which interacts with GRM5, a G protein-coupled receptor linked to glutamate signaling. This activates GNAQ, leading to PLCB isoforms that generate inositol triphosphate (IP3), which releases calcium from mitochondria via MCU. Increased mitochondrial calcium can trigger apoptosis through APAF1, CASP9, and CASP3, leading to neuronal death. This cascade contributes to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline, all hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The accumulation of Abeta also disrupts neuronal communication and promotes oxidative stress, further exacerbating the disease.

This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), keeping it active and inhibiting the E2F transcription factor. When CDKN2A is inactivated (e.g., due to mutations or deletions), CDK4/6 activity increases, leading to RB1 inactivation and uncontrolled E2F activity. E2F then promotes cell cycle progression, particularly into the G1 phase, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. This mechanism is central to the development of various cancers, especially those with defects in the cell cycle control pathway.

Mutations in SOD1 are associated with increased oxidative stress, which can lead to neuronal damage. This gene is most famously linked to **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The SOD1 allele contributes to ALS by promoting misfolding and aggregation of the SOD1 protein, which leads to neurotoxicity and the progressive loss of motor neurons. Additionally, SOD1 mutations can also contribute to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as certain forms of frontotemporal dementia.
