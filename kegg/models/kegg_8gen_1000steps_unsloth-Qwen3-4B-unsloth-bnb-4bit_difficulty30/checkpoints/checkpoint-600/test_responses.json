Mutations in the TARDBP gene are associated with amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. This protein plays a critical role in the stability of RNA and the function of motor neurons. Defective TARDBP can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and impaired RNA processing, contributing to neuronal death. Additionally, TARDBP is part of the granular locus in neurons, which is important for maintaining neuronal health. Mutations in this gene are a known cause of familial ALS and are linked to the dysfunction of motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy.

This increases mitochondrial calcium levels, leading to the release of cytochrome c, which activates APAF1, CASP9, and CASP3, promoting apoptosis. This pathway contributes to neurotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death, all of which are key features of Alzheimer's disease.

This leads to the activation of GNAQ and subsequent PLCB enzymes, which produce IP3, leading to calcium release via ITPR receptors. This calcium influx activates MCU, increasing mitochondrial calcium levels, which can trigger mitochondrial dysfunction.

The ATXN1 allele contributes to this disease by causing an expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the ataxin-1 protein, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death in the cerebellum. The pathway involving ATXN1, RORA, KAT5, ITPR1, SLC1A6, and GRM1 likely reflects upstream regulatory mechanisms that influence neuronal function and maintenance. Mutations in ATXN1 disrupt these pathways, leading to impaired cellular processes such as ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter regulation, and synaptic function, all of which contribute to the pathogenesis of SCA1. \n\n\\boxed{Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 1 (SCA1)}"], ["user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

CDKN2A is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes p16, which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4/6), preventing cell cycle progression. Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation. In the context of the provided pathway, CDKN2A interacts with the RB1 gene and E2F transcription factors to regulate the G1 checkpoint of the cell cycle. Mutations in CDKN2A are associated with various cancers, including retinoblastoma, a pediatric tumor of the retina. Loss of CDKN2A function, often due to deletions or mutations, allows cells to bypass cell cycle arrest, leading to uncontrolled growth. Additionally, CDKN2A\u2019s role in inhibiting CDK4/6 and RB1 is crucial for preventing the activation of E2F transcription factors, which promote cell cycle entry.

Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell cycle progression. This allele contributes to cancer development, particularly in the context of the p53 (TP53) and Rb (RB1) pathways. CDKN2A deficiency can result in the activation of the E2F transcription factor, promoting cell proliferation. This is associated with various cancers, most notably **melanoma**. Additionally, CDKN2A mutations are linked to **retinoblastoma** when combined with RB1 mutations. The loss of CDKN2A also promotes the expression of cyclins (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3) and CDK4/6, leading to increased activation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway, which drives cell cycle progression. The cumulative effect of CDKN2A loss is increased cellular proliferation and reduced apoptosis, contributing to melanoma and other cancers.\n\n\\boxed{Melanoma}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell cycle progression. It is associated with various cancers, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and lung cancer. CDKN2A also interacts with MDM2 and TP53, which are critical in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Loss of CDKN2A can lead to resistance to p53-mediated apoptosis and decreased expression of CDKN1A, promoting cell proliferation. The pathway involving CDKN2A, MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, CCND, CDK4/6, and RB1 is central to cell cycle control and tumor suppression. Defective CDKN2A function contributes to the development of cancers by disrupting the G1 checkpoint, leading to uncontrolled cell division. The biological effect of a defective CDKN2A allele is increased risk of cancer, particularly in cells where p53 is functional.\n\n\\boxed{Melanoma}"]]
