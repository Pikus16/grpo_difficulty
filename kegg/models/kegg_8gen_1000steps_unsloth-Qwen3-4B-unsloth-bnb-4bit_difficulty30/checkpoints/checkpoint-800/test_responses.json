Mutations in the TARDBP gene are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. TARDBP plays a critical role in the clearance of misfolded proteins, and disruptions in its function can lead to the accumulation of toxic proteins, such as TDP-43, which is a hallmark of ALS. Additionally, TARDBP is involved in the formation of RNA granules, which are crucial for proper RNA processing and transport. Defects in TARDBP contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS by impairing cellular homeostasis and increasing neuronal vulnerability.

ATXN1 mutations lead to the accumulation of a toxic protein, ataxin-1, which forms neurofibrillary tangles and promotes neuronal death, particularly in the cerebellum. The pathway involving ATXN1, RORA, KAT5, ITPR1, SLC1A6, and GRM1 may contribute to disrupted cellular functions such as ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter signaling, and neuronal survival. These molecular changes further exacerbate the neurodegenerative process in SCA1. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the ATXN1 gene.\n\n\\boxed{Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 1 (SCA1)}"], ["user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

CDKN2A encodes p16, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that negatively regulates CDK4/6. Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation by inhibiting G1 phase cell cycle progression. This promotes tumor development, particularly in cells with mutations in TP53 or RB1. The pathway shown involves CDKN2A inhibiting MDM2 and TP53, which in turn regulate CDKN1A and E2F. Loss of CDKN2A function removes this braking mechanism, leading to increased CDK4/6 activity, reduced RB1 activity, and unchecked cell proliferation. This pathway is critical in retinoblastoma, a childhood cancer of the retina, where mutations in CDKN2A and RB1 are commonly found. \\boxed{Retinoblastoma}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 9\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: CDKN2A* // MDM2 -| TP53 => CDKN1A -| (CCND+CDK4/6) -> RB1 // E2F\nGenes in the pathway: CDKN2A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | MDM2; MDM2 proto-oncogene | TP53; tumor protein p53 | CDKN1A; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A | CCND1; cyclin D1 | CCND2; cyclin D2 | CCND3; cyclin D3 | CDK4; cyclin dependent kinase 4 | CDK6; cyclin dependent kinase 6 | RB1; RB transcriptional corepressor 1 | E2F1; E2F transcription factor 1 | E2F2; E2F transcription factor 2 | E2F3; E2F transcription factor 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this CDKN2A allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Additionally, CDKN2A mutations are associated with ** melanoma**, **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**, and **multiple myeloma**. The loss of CDKN2A leads to loss of growth control, promoting tumorigenesis.

Loss of CDKN2A function leads to uncontrolled cell cycle progression, particularly in the G1 phase, by allowing cyclin D/CDK4/6 to phosphorylate RB1, releasing E2F transcription factors. This promotes cell proliferation and can lead to oncogenic transformation. CDKN2A mutations are associated with several cancers, including **melanoma**, **pancreatic cancer**, and **lung cancer**. Additionally, CDKN2A is a key player in the development of **cervical cancer** and **carcinoma**. The loss of CDKN2A function contributes to the progression of **retinoblastoma** by causing RB1 dysfunction. Therefore, the biological effect of a loss-of-function CDKN2A allele is to promote tumor formation, particularly in **melanoma**, **pancreatic cancer**, and other cancers.\n\n\\boxed{Melanoma}"]]
