Mutations in TARDBP are strongly associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43 pathology, characterized by the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43 protein, is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In FTLD, TARDBP mutations lead to loss of function and neuronal degeneration, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes. In ALS, TDP-43 aggregates contribute to motor neuron death. The pathway involving TARDBP and components of complex I (NDUFA/B/C/S subunits) suggests a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

These aggregates contribute to neurodegeneration by interfering with protein homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and possibly by triggering inflammatory responses. The pathway involving DERL1, ubiquitin (UBA52, UBB, UBC), and the proteasome subunits (PSMA, PSMB, PSMC, PSMD) reflects the cellular attempt to degrade these misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Dysfunction in this pathway exacerbates the accumulation of toxic SOD1 species, accelerating neuronal death.

The pathway illustrates how APP is processed into Abeta, which then interacts with CxIV (likely a cofactor or chaperone), leading to the production of water (H2O), suggesting a role in amyloid aggregation or clearance. The presence of multiple COX subunits indicates a potential link to mitochondrial dysfunction, as COX is a critical component of the electron transport chain. The accumulation of Abeta is central to Alzheimer's pathology, leading to neurodegeneration through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death.
