Mutations in TARDBP are associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, TARDBP mutations contribute to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), particularly the FTLD with ubiquitin-positive bodies (FTLD-U). In these conditions, TDP-43 aggregates in neurons and glia, leading to neuronal loss and dysfunction. TARDBP variants also increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.

Mutations in KCNC3 are associated with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), a genetic epilepsy syndrome. These mutations typically result in altered channel function, leading to hyperexcitability of neurons and increased susceptibility to seizures. The pathway involving K+ and KCNC3 is essential for maintaining proper membrane potential and action potential repolarization. Impaired function of this channel disrupts neural excitability, contributing to seizure onset. KCNC3 variants are also linked to other epilepsy-related phenotypes, including myoclonic epilepsy with roach-like myoclonus (MERRF) in some cases. The biological effect of the KCNC3 allele is thus a disruption in neuronal ion homeostasis, leading to epileptic activity. \n\n\\boxed{Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 19\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: K+ // KCNC3* // K+(extracellular)\nGenes in the pathway: KCNC3; potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 3\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this KCNC3 allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

The pathway involving DERL1, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation reflects the cell's attempt to degrade misfolded SOD1, but failed clearance contributes to disease progression.
