Mutations in TARDBP, which encodes TDP-43, lead to protein misfolding and aggregation, contributing to neurodegeneration. TDP-43 is a key RNA-binding protein that regulates RNA processing and stability. In ALS, TDP-43 forms insoluble inclusions in affected neurons, disrupting normal cellular functions. This disruption impairs protein homeostasis, RNA metabolism, and synaptic function, ultimately leading to motor neuron death. TARDBP mutations are one of the genetic causes of both familial and sporadic ALS. The pathway includes complex I subunits, implying a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal degeneration. The biological effect of TARDBP mutations is thus the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. \n\n\\boxed{Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 1\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: TARDBP* -| CxI -> Q\nGenes in the pathway: TARDBP; TAR DNA binding protein | ND1; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 1 (complex I) | ND2; MTND2 | ND3; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 3 (complex I) | ND4; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 4 (complex I) | ND5; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 5 (complex I) | ND6; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 6 (complex I) | NDUFS1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1 | NDUFS2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S2 | NDUFS3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S3 | NDUFS4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 | NDUFS5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S5 | NDUFS6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S6 | NDUFS7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S7 | NDUFS8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 | NDUFV1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V1 | NDUFV2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2 | NDUFV3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit V3 | NDUFA1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A1 | NDUFA2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A2 | NDUFA3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A3 | NDUFA4; NDUFA4 mitochondrial complex associated | NDUFA5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A5 | NDUFA6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A6 | NDUFA7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A7 | NDUFA8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A8 | NDUFA9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A9 | NDUFA10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A10 | NDUFAB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1 | NDUFA11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A11 | NDUFA12; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A12 | NDUFA13; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A13 | NDUFB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B1 | NDUFB2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B2 | NDUFB3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B3 | NDUFB4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B4 | NDUFB5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B5 | NDUFB6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B6 | NDUFB7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B7 | NDUFB8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8 | NDUFB9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 | NDUFB10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B10 | NDUFB11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B11 | NDUFC1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C1 | NDUFC2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this TARDBP allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

The inclusion of genes encoding proteasome subunits (e.g., PSMA and PSMB families) suggests impaired proteasomal function may lead to the accumulation of toxic Abeta peptides. This accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, where misfolded and aggregated Abeta contributes to neurodegeneration.

Mutations in ATXN3 lead to the expansion of polyglutamine repeats, resulting in the production of a toxic protein that accumulates in neurons. This accumulation disrupts cellular function and leads to neurodegeneration. The specific disease associated with ATXN3 mutations is Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2). SCA2 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive loss of coordination, gait instability, and cognitive decline due to the degeneration of cerebellar and brainstem neurons. The pathogenic mechanism involves the toxic gain-of-function of mutant ATXN3, which disrupts proteostasis and leads to neuronal cell death. \\boxed{Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 14\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: Glutamate -> GRM1 -> GNAQ -> PLCB -> IP3 -> (ITPR1+(ATXN2*,ATXN3*)) -> Ca2+ -- MCU -> Ca2+(mito) -- MPTP -> CYCS\nGenes in the pathway: GRM1; glutamate metabotropic receptor 1 | GNAQ; G protein subunit alpha q | PLCB1; phospholipase C beta 1 | PLCB2; phospholipase C beta 2 | PLCB3; phospholipase C beta 3 | PLCB4; phospholipase C beta 4 | ITPR1; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 | ATXN2; ataxin 2 | ATXN3; ataxin 3 | MCU; mitochondrial calcium uniporter | VDAC1; voltage dependent anion channel 1 | VDAC2; voltage dependent anion channel 2 | VDAC3; voltage dependent anion channel 3 | SLC25A4; solute carrier family 25 member 4 | SLC25A5; solute carrier family 25 member 5 | SLC25A6; solute carrier family 25 member 6 | SLC25A31; solute carrier family 25 member 31 | CYCS; cytochrome c, somatic\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this ATXN3 allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.
