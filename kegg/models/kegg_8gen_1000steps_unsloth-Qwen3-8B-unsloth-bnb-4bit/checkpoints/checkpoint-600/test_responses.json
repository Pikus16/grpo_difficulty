This aberrant signaling is implicated in various cancers. The most notable disease associated with BRAF mutations is melanoma, where BRAF V600E is present in approximately 50% of cases. Additionally, BRAF mutations are also found in other malignancies such as colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and thyroid carcinoma.
