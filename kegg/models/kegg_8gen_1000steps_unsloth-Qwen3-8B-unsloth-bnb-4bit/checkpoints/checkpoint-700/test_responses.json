Mutations in the SOD1 gene lead to the production of abnormal superoxide dismutase 1 protein, which gains toxic properties and disrupts neuronal function. This toxicity contributes to the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, a hallmark of ALS. The pathway involving SOD1 and dynactin subunits, along with dynein axonemal components, suggests a role in intracellular transport and axonal maintenance. Dysfunction in these processes can impair neuronal health, accelerating disease progression. SOD1-linked ALS is a familial form of the disease, though sporadic cases can also involve SOD1 mutations. The inclusion of multiple dynactin and dynein subunits highlights the importance of microtubule-based transport in maintaining neuronal integrity.

This triggers the activation of FAS, FADD, and caspase 8, which in turn activates BID. BID promotes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria via BAX and BAK1, activating APAF1 and caspase 9, ultimately leading to activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis.
