Mutations in TARDBP are strongly associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In particular, TARDBP mutations lead to the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. This pathology is a hallmark of FTLD with TDP-43 proteinopathy and is also observed in ALS. The disruption of TDP-43 in the pathway involving complex I subunits suggests a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. These mutations impair RNA metabolism and protein homeostasis, leading to progressive neuronal loss. The biological effect of the TARDBP allele is therefore a key contributor to TDP-43-related neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\\boxed{Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 1\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: TARDBP* -| CxI -> Q\nGenes in the pathway: TARDBP; TAR DNA binding protein | ND1; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 1 (complex I) | ND2; MTND2 | ND3; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 3 (complex I) | ND4; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 4 (complex I) | ND5; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 5 (complex I) | ND6; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 6 (complex I) | NDUFS1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1 | NDUFS2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S2 | NDUFS3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S3 | NDUFS4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 | NDUFS5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S5 | NDUFS6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S6 | NDUFS7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S7 | NDUFS8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 | NDUFV1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V1 | NDUFV2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2 | NDUFV3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit V3 | NDUFA1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A1 | NDUFA2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A2 | NDUFA3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A3 | NDUFA4; NDUFA4 mitochondrial complex associated | NDUFA5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A5 | NDUFA6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A6 | NDUFA7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A7 | NDUFA8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A8 | NDUFA9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A9 | NDUFA10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A10 | NDUFAB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1 | NDUFA11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A11 | NDUFA12; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A12 | NDUFA13; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A13 | NDUFB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B1 | NDUFB2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B2 | NDUFB3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B3 | NDUFB4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B4 | NDUFB5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B5 | NDUFB6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B6 | NDUFB7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B7 | NDUFB8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8 | NDUFB9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 | NDUFB10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B10 | NDUFB11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B11 | NDUFC1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C1 | NDUFC2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this TARDBP allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Mutations in ATXN3 are causative for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of motor coordination. ATXN3 encodes ataxin-3, an ubiquitin ligase involved in protein quality control. Pathogenic expansions of the polyglutamine tract in ATXN3 lead to protein misfolding, aggregation, and neurotoxicity, particularly in cerebellar neurons. This disrupts calcium homeostasis via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), impairing energy metabolism and triggering apoptosis. These molecular mechanisms underlie the clinical features of SCA2, including ataxia, dysarthria, and eventual neurological decline.
