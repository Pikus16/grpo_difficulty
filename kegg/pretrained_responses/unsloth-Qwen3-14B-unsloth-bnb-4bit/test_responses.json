Mutations in PSEN1 are strongly associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this pathway, PSEN1 activates GSK3B, which phosphorylates tau protein, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation. GSK3B also interacts with KIF5 and KLC proteins, which are essential for intracellular transport. Dysregulation of this pathway may impair axonal transport and contribute to neurodegeneration.

SNCA encodes alpha-synuclein, a protein that accumulates in Lewy bodies, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Mutations or overexpression of SNCA are linked to the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, leading to neurodegeneration in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. This pathway involves interactions with the 26S proteasome, which is critical for protein degradation. Dysfunctional proteasome activity may impair the clearance of alpha-synuclein, exacerbating its pathological accumulation. Thus, SNCA's role in proteasome dysfunction and protein misfolding underlies its contribution to Parkinson's disease.  \n\\boxed{Parkinson's disease}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 4\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: SNCA* -| 26S\nGenes in the pathway: SNCA; synuclein alpha | PSMA6; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 6 | PSMA2; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 2 | PSMA4; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 4 | PSMA7; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 7 | PSMA8; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 8 | PSMA5; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 5 | PSMA1; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 1 | PSMA3; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 3 | PSMB6; proteasome 20S subunit beta 6 | PSMB7; proteasome 20S subunit beta 7 | PSMB3; proteasome 20S subunit beta 3 | PSMB2; proteasome 20S subunit beta 2 | PSMB5; proteasome 20S subunit beta 5 | PSMB1; proteasome 20S subunit beta 1 | PSMB4; proteasome 20S subunit beta 4 | PSMC2; proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 2 | PSMC1; proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 1 | PSMC4; proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 4 | PSMC6; proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 6 | PSMC3; proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 3 | PSMC5; proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 5 | PSMD2; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 2 | PSMD1; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 1 | PSMD3; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 3 | PSMD9; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 9 | PSMD12; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 12 | PSMD11; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 11 | PSMD6; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 6 | PSMD7; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 7 | PSMD13; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 13 | PSMD4; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 4 | PSMD14; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 14 | PSMD8; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 8 | ADRM1; adhesion regulating molecule 1 | SEM1; SEM1 26S proteasome complex subunit\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this SNCA allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.
