Mutations in the TARDBP gene are associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a group of progressive neurological disorders characterized by the degeneration of neurons in the brain's frontal and temporal lobes. Specifically, TARDBP mutations contribute to a subtype of FTD known as frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP-71), which is linked to the accumulation of misfolded tau proteins and the presence of intermediate neurofibrillary tangles. This condition is also associated with motor neuron disease and can present with symptoms such as behavioral changes, speech difficulties, and movement disorders. The disruption in TARDBP function leads to impaired RNA processing and neuronal dysfunction, contributing to the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease.\n\n\\boxed{Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 1\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: TARDBP* -| CxI -> Q\nGenes in the pathway: TARDBP; TAR DNA binding protein | ND1; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 1 (complex I) | ND2; MTND2 | ND3; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 3 (complex I) | ND4; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 4 (complex I) | ND5; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 5 (complex I) | ND6; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 6 (complex I) | NDUFS1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1 | NDUFS2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S2 | NDUFS3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S3 | NDUFS4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 | NDUFS5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S5 | NDUFS6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S6 | NDUFS7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S7 | NDUFS8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 | NDUFV1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V1 | NDUFV2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2 | NDUFV3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit V3 | NDUFA1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A1 | NDUFA2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A2 | NDUFA3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A3 | NDUFA4; NDUFA4 mitochondrial complex associated | NDUFA5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A5 | NDUFA6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A6 | NDUFA7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A7 | NDUFA8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A8 | NDUFA9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A9 | NDUFA10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A10 | NDUFAB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1 | NDUFA11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A11 | NDUFA12; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A12 | NDUFA13; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A13 | NDUFB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B1 | NDUFB2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B2 | NDUFB3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B3 | NDUFB4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B4 | NDUFB5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B5 | NDUFB6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B6 | NDUFB7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B7 | NDUFB8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8 | NDUFB9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 | NDUFB10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B10 | NDUFB11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B11 | NDUFC1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C1 | NDUFC2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this TARDBP allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Mutations in the TARDBP gene are strongly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. TARDBP is involved in the stability and processing of mRNA, and its dysfunction can lead to the improper degradation of RNA, contributing to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and neuronal death.

Mutations in FGFR3 are associated with skeletal disorders, such as achondroplasia and similar conditions. In the given pathway, FGFR3 activates GRB2, leading to the activation of SOS, which in turn activates RAS. This activates RAF, MEK, and ERK, which can promote cell proliferation and survival. Hyperactivation of this pathway is linked to cancer development. Specifically, FGFR3 mutations are associated with cancer, particularly in bone and soft tissue tumors. Additionally, FGFR3 mutations are linked to developmental disorders and certain types of cancer, including chondrosarcoma and other sarcomas.

Mutations in SNCA can lead to the formation of Lewy bodies, which are pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. The SNCA gene is also implicated in the development of Parkinson's disease, particularly in cases where the gene is duplicated or triplicated. The SNCA protein is a key component of the synaptic vesicle membrane and plays a role in dopamine regulation. Mutations in SNCA have been linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. The SNCA allele contributes to Parkinson's disease by promoting the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, which disrupts normal dopamine signaling and leads to the death of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra.\n\n\\boxed{Parkinson's disease}", "user\nSolve the following genomic pathway question:\nChromosome Number: 4\nNetwork Definition of the pathway: SNCA* -| CxI -> Q\nGenes in the pathway: SNCA; synuclein alpha | ND1; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 1 (complex I) | ND2; MTND2 | ND3; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 3 (complex I) | ND4; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 4 (complex I) | ND5; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 5 (complex I) | ND6; NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 6 (complex I) | NDUFS1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1 | NDUFS2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S2 | NDUFS3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S3 | NDUFS4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 | NDUFS5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S5 | NDUFS6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S6 | NDUFS7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S7 | NDUFS8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 | NDUFV1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V1 | NDUFV2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2 | NDUFV3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit V3 | NDUFA1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A1 | NDUFA2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A2 | NDUFA3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A3 | NDUFA4; NDUFA4 mitochondrial complex associated | NDUFA5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A5 | NDUFA6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A6 | NDUFA7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A7 | NDUFA8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A8 | NDUFA9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A9 | NDUFA10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A10 | NDUFAB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1 | NDUFA11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A11 | NDUFA12; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A12 | NDUFA13; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A13 | NDUFB1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B1 | NDUFB2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B2 | NDUFB3; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B3 | NDUFB4; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B4 | NDUFB5; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B5 | NDUFB6; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B6 | NDUFB7; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B7 | NDUFB8; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8 | NDUFB9; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 | NDUFB10; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B10 | NDUFB11; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B11 | NDUFC1; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C1 | NDUFC2; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2\n\nGiven this context, what is the biological effect of this SNCA allele, specifically what disease does this contribute to?\nAnswer concisely, in 150 words or less.

Mutations in PRNP are most famously associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by prion protein misfolding and aggregation. The prion protein's role in calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function may contribute to the pathogenesis of CJD, as disruptions in these processes can lead to neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. Additionally, the PRNP allele can contribute to other prion-related diseases, including variant CJD (vCJD) and familial CJD. The misfolding of the prion protein initiates a cascade of pathological events, leading to neuronal death and brain degeneration.

Mutations in the SOD1 gene are a major cause of **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. These mutations lead to the accumulation of misfolded SOD1 proteins, which can aggregate and toxicify neurons, particularly motor neurons. This contributes to the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and ultimately, death. The SOD1 pathway is also linked to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and maintenance of cellular homeostasis.
