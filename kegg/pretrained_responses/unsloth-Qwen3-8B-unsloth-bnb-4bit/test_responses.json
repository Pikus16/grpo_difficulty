This proteinopathy is also a key pathological feature in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where TARDBP mutations contribute to the disease by disrupting normal TDP-43 function, leading to RNA processing defects and neuronal dysfunction.

Mutations in TARDBP are a well-established cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. TDP-43 dysfunction leads to the mislocalization and aggregation of the protein in neuronal cytoplasm, contributing to neuronal toxicity. This pathological hallmark is also observed in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a group of disorders affecting the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. TDP-43 pathology is one of the most common genetic causes of familial ALS and is increasingly implicated in sporadic cases. The interaction between TARDBP and complex I subunits (including ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND5, ND6, and others) suggests a potential role in mitochondrial function, which is often impaired in neurodegenerative diseases.

Mutations in PRKN lead to impaired mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress. This disruption contributes to neurodegeneration. The pathway involves PLCG1, which generates IP3, activating ITPR (inositol triphosphate receptors) to release Ca\u00b2\u207a from the endoplasmic reticulum. Disruption of this pathway can lead to aberrant calcium signaling, further exacerbating cellular damage. Mutations in PRKN are a known cause of Parkinson's disease, specifically in cases of early-onset, recessive Parkinsonism.

This dysfunction impairs the clearance of misfolded proteins, leading to neurodegeneration. The pathway includes ubiquitin ligases (e.g., DERL1), ubiquitin proteins (UBA52, UBB, UBC), and proteasome subunits (PSMA, PSMB, PSMC, PSMD), all of which are critical for protein degradation. Impaired proteasomal processing of SOD1 results in toxic accumulation of mutant protein in motor neurons, contributing to selective neurodegeneration. This pathway is strongly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons.

Mutations in SOD1 are well-documented in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons.

Mutations in SOD1 are well-documented in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. In this pathway, SOD1 is likely to interact with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is critical for protein quality control. Mutant SOD1 can misfold, aggregate, and disrupt proteasomal function, leading to neuronal toxicity.

In the context of the provided pathway, SOD1 is linked to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is critical for protein degradation. Mutant SOD1 proteins can misfold and accumulate, interfering with the UPS by forming aggregates that inhibit proteasomal activity. This disruption leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins, contributing to neuronal toxicity. The pathway also involves proteasome subunits (e.g., PSMA and PSMB), which are essential for protein degradation.

This process is essential for the removal of misfolded or damaged proteins. When SOD1 is mutant, it can resist degradation, leading to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates. This contributes to neuronal stress and death, hallmark features of ALS.

SOD1 encodes superoxide dismutase 1, an enzyme that normally scavenges superoxide radicals. Mutations in SOD1 lead to the production of toxic protein conformers that aggregate and disrupt cellular processes, particularly in motor neurons. These misfolded SOD1 proteins can also impair the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is critical for protein quality control. The pathway described involves DERL1, ubiquitin ligases (UBA52, UBB, UBC), and proteasome subunits (PSMA and PSMB proteins), all of which are essential for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of misfolded proteins. When SOD1 is mutated, it contributes to proteasome dysfunction, leading to the accumulation of damaged proteins and neuronal death.

Mutations in PRKN are associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. The pathway involving PRKN, along with UBCH7/8 (E2 conjugating enzymes) and GPR37, is critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and protein quality control. Impaired PRKN function leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged mitochondria, contributing to neuronal death. This is particularly evident in dopaminergic neurons, which are vulnerable to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Loss-of-function PRKN alleles result in reduced ubiquitination of target proteins, disrupting the proteasome system and leading to neurodegeneration. This pathway is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, making PRKN a key player in its development.

The pathway described, APP \u2192 Abeta \u2192 CxIV \u2192 H2O, illustrates the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides from the APP protein. Abnormal accumulation of Abeta leads to the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. These plaques disrupt cellular function and trigger neuroinflammation, ultimately contributing to neuronal death and cognitive decline. The involvement of cytochrome c oxidase subunits (COX1-COX8C) suggests a potential link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, as these subunits are critical for oxidative phosphorylation. Impaired mitochondrial function can exacerbate oxidative stress and neuronal damage, further supporting the progression of the disease.

Mutations in ATXN1 are a well-known cause of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of coordination and motor control. The expansion of CAG repeats in ATXN1 leads to the production of an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in ataxin-1, resulting in protein misfolding, aggregation, and neuronal toxicity, particularly in cerebellar neurons.
