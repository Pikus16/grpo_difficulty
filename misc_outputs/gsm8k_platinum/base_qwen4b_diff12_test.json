However, the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which is a bit confusing. It seems like the 5% of the more dangerous candles refers to the 1% that are guaranteed to explode. \n\nSo, if 5% of the more dangerous candles (which are the 1% that are guaranteed to explode) have the wet dog smell, then 5% of 1% of the total candles will be both guaranteed to explode and smell like wet dog. \n\nCalculating that: 5% of 1% is 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005. \n\nThen, we multiply that by the total number of candles, which is 50,000. \n\n0.0005 * 5", " \n\n        Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n        Step 1: Determine the value of the sapphires Jenna starts with.

She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so that's 4 * $5 = $20. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as x. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her earnings from mowing the lawn are 4x dollars. \n\n        She already has $10 saved, so her total money is the $10 she already has plus the money she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:\n   $$\n   3 \\times 800 = 2400\n   $$\n\n3. **Value of the Rubies**: Each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the 2 rubies she receives is:\n   $$\n   2", " Let's break this down step by step.\n\n        First, let's calculate how much Sara needs to spend in total. The jacket is $30 and each pair of shoes is $20. So, for 2 pairs of shoes, that's 2*20 = $40. Adding the jacket, the total cost is 30 + 40 = $70.\n\n        Next, let's calculate how much money Sara has. She already had $10 saved. Then, she babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time. So, 4*5 = $20 from babysitting. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as x. So, the total money she has is 10 + 20 + 4x.\n\n        Now, to find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we set up the equation: 10 + 20 + 4x = 70. Solving for x, we add 10 and 20 to get 30. Then, 70 - 30 = 40", " (Note: Profit is total revenue minus total cost.)\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the profit per hour that Millie makes from her lemonade stand. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Costs:**\n   - Millie spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.\n   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cups she can make is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.\n   - The total cost is $18.\n\n2. **Revenue:**\n   - She sells each cup for $1.\n   - If she sells all the lemonade, the total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.\n   - However, we are asked for profit per hour, and we know that she sells an average of 4 cups per hour.\n   - So, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade, and then calculate the profit per hour.\n\n3. **Time to Sell All Lemonade:**\n   - She sells 4 cups per hour.\n  ", " \n\n        The problem is about solving for the number of insects that Lily found. Let's break down the given information.\n\n        Let's denote the number of insects that David found as D. Then, according to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily's insects can be expressed as D + 7. \n\n        It's also stated that David found half of what Bodhi found. Let's denote the number of insects that Bodhi found as B. Then, D = (1/2) * B. This implies that B = 2D.\n\n        The total number of insects collected by the three is 43. So, adding up the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi: (D + 7) + D + B = 43. \n\n        Substituting B = 2D into the equation, we get: (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43. Combining like terms: 4D + 7 = 43.\n\n        Now, subtract 7 from both sides: 4D = 36. Then, divide both sides by 4: D = 9.\n\n        Now that we know", " The answer should be a positive integer, but the steps must be accurate.\n\n        To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more years Lauren needs to work before she can retire, given her current salary, her savings rate, and the retirement period. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her annual salary. Her current salary is $100,000. So, the amount she saves each year is 20% of $100,000, which is 0.2 * 100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\nStep 2: Determine how much she can spend each year when she retires. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary. Her current salary is $100,000, so the amount she can spend each year is 40% of $100,000, which is 0.4 * 100,000 = $40,000 per year.\n\nStep 3: Determine the difference between her"], [" \n\n        Think about how to approach this problem. \n\nFirst, let's break down the problem step by step. \n\nInitially, there are 48 people on the bus. \n\nAt the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people remaining on the bus after the first stop is 48 - 8 = 40 people. \n\nThen, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. The number who got off was 8, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80 people. \n\nAt the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people remaining on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59 people. \n\nThen, 3 times fewer passengers get on. The phrase \"3 times fewer\" can be a bit ambiguous, but it typically means dividing the number by 3. So, if 21 passengers got off, then 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on.

The length is 12 mm. Therefore, the used length is 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm.\n\nThird, for the third glue stick, 1/2 is left. So, the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length is 12 mm.

This means 1% of the candles are expected to explode.\n3. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what the 5% refers to. The problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. However, the problem does not specify how many of the candles are \"more dangerous.\" Since the problem does not give us specific numbers about the proportion of dangerous candles, we can assume that \"more dangerous candles\" refers to the 1% that are expected to explode (since those are the ones that are more likely to explode). Therefore, 5% of the 1% of candles that explode will have the wet dog smell.\n\nSo, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n1.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes would be 2 times $20, which is $40. So, the total cost is $30 (jacket) plus $40 (shoes) equals $70. \n\nNow, Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she does this 4 times. So, her earnings from babysitting would be 4 times $5, which is $20. \n\nAdditionally, she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's call the number of times she mows the lawn 'x'. Therefore, her earnings from mowing the lawn would be $4 times x. \n\nThe total money she has is her savings plus her earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

She buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.\n2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so in total, she has 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.\n3. She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all of them, she gets 36 * $1 = $36 from sales.\n4. Her total cost for the supplies is $18, so her total profit is $36 (sales) - $18 (cost) = $18.\n\nNow, we are told that she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. So, in one hour, she sells 4 cups. If she sells all the lemonade, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups. That would be 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.\n\nSo, she makes a total profit of $18 over the course of 9 hours.

The problem states that Lily found 7 more than David. Also, David found half of what Bodhi found. We need to find out how many insects Lily found.\n\nFirst, let me assign variables to each person's insects. Let me call the number of insects David found as D. Then, according to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David. So, Lily's insects would be D + 7. \n\nNext, David found half of what Bodhi found. That means Bodhi found twice as many as David. So, Bodhi's insects would be 2D.\n\nNow, the total insects collected by all three is 43. So, adding up Lily, David, and Bodhi's insects: Lily's + David's + Bodhi's = 43. \n\nSubstituting the variables, that would be (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43. Let me check that again.

But we need to find how many of the candles both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem says that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. That means only 1% of the candles will explode. \n\nNow, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Are the \"more dangerous candles\" the ones that are 99% guaranteed not to explode? If that's the case, then the 1% that explode are not in the more dangerous category. But that might not be what's meant. Let me re-read the problem. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode.\" So that means 99% are not exploded, so 1% are exploded. Then, it says \"5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.\" The term \"more dangerous candles\" is not clearly defined here.

That's 8 * 800 = $6400. \n\nThen she trades 3 sapphires. So she gives up 3 sapphires, which would be 3 * 800 = $2400. But she gets two rubies in exchange. Each ruby is worth $1200, so two rubies are 2 * 1200 = $2400. So the value here is the same, right? She's trading 3 sapphires (worth $2400) for two rubies (also worth $2400). So in terms of total value, the trade doesn't change the total value", " Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, for 2 pairs of shoes, that's 2 * $20 = $40. Adding the jacket, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Sara has already saved. She already had $10 saved. She babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time. So, from babysitting, she gets 4 * $5 = $20. Then, her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let x be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn. So, from mowing the lawn, she gets x * $4.\n\nSo, the total amount of money Sara has is $10 (saved) + $20 (from babysitting) + $4x (from mowing the lawn).

If she sells all the lemonade, we need to find out how many cups she has in total. She has 3 pitchers, each holding 12 cups, so 3*12 = 36 cups total. She makes $1 per cup, so 36 cups * $1 = $36. Then, profit is total revenue minus cost. So, $36 - $18 = $18 profit. But this is the total profit for the entire time she has the lemonade. However, the question asks for profit per hour. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, we need to figure out how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. So, 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours. Then, $18 profit over 9 hours is $2 per hour.

Lily found 7 more than David.\n3. David found half of what Bodhi found.\n\nSo, I need to set up equations based on these points.\n\nLet me assign variables to each person's collection. Let's say:\n\nLet L = number of insects Lily found.\n\nD = number of insects David found.\n\nB = number of insects Bodhi found.\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n\nL = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David).\n\nAlso, David found half of what Bodhi found. So, D = (1/2)B, which implies B = 2D.\n\nAlso, the total insects are 43. So:\n\nL + D + B = 43.\n\n", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many more years Lauren needs to work before she can retire, considering she saves 20% of her paycheck and plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary. \n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much money Lauren needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year. \n\nHowever, the problem is not directly stating the total amount she needs to save for retirement. Instead, it's saying she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. Assuming that she needs to have a certain amount saved to support her for 20 years at the retirement salary. But there's a missing piece here: the total amount she needs to have saved for her retirement. \n\nActually, the problem might be interpreted differently.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.\n\n**First Stop:**\n- 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers now is:\n  $$\n  48 - 8 = 40\n  $$\n- Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on. Since 8 passengers got off, 5 times that number is:\n  $$\n  5 \\times 8 = 40\n  $$\n  Adding these to the current number of passengers:\n  $$\n  40 + 40 = 80\n  $$\n\n**Second Stop:**\n- 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers now is:\n  $$\n  80 - 21 = 59\n  $$\n- 3 times fewer passengers get on. This phrase can be interpreted as one-third of the number that got off. Since 21 passengers got off, one-third of", " \n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is not used and then add them up. \n\nFirst, let's find out how much is not used for each glue stick. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, we can calculate the length not used by multiplying the fraction of the glue stick that is left by 12. \n\nFor the first glue stick, 1/6 is left, so the not used length is 12 - (1/6 * 12) = 12 - 2 = 10 millimeters.\n\nFor the second glue stick, 2/3 is left, so the not used length is 12 - (2/3 * 12) = 12 - 8 = 4 millimeters.\n\nFor the third glue stick, 1/2 is left, so the not used length is 12 - (1/2 * 12) = 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters.\n\nNow, adding up the not used lengths from all three glue sticks: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.\n\nSo the total length", " For example, if the answer is 5, the answer should be \"Answer: 005\".\nAnswer:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many candles are both \"smelly like wet dog\" and \"explode.\" Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\n\nMarcy sells 50,000 candles. The problem gives two key pieces of information:\n\n1. **99% guaranteed not to explode**: This means that **1% of the candles are expected to explode**.\n2. **5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog**: This means that **5% of the candles that are more dangerous** also smell like wet dog.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the problem doesn't directly say that the more dangerous candles are the ones that explode. So we need to clarify:\n\n- \"More dangerous candles\" are the ones that **explode**. Since 1% of the candles are expected to explode (as 99% are not), then **1% of 50,000 candles** are the **exploding** ones.\n- Of those **exploding** candles, **5%", " \n\n        Let's think:\n\n        First, calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna starts with. She has 8 sapphires, and each is worth $800. So, 8 * 800 = $6400.\n\n        Then, Jenna trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. Let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades. 3 sapphires * $800 each = $2400.\n\n        Now, she receives two rubies. Each ruby is worth $120 Nokia, so two rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.\n\n        So, the value of the sapphires she traded is $2400, and the value of the rubies she received is also $2400. This means there is no net gain or loss in terms of value from the trade.\n\n        Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is the value of the remaining sapphires plus the value of the rubies.\n\n        She started with 8 sapphires, traded 3, so she has 5 sapph", " \n\n        Also, please put your final answer in a box.\n\n        Also, please make sure that you are not using any markdown format, and just provide the final answer as a single integer in the format \"Answer: XXX\" with no extra formatting. \n\n        Also, please make sure that you are not using any markdown format, and just provide the final answer as a single integer in the format \"Answer: XXX\" with no extra formatting.\n\n        Also, please make sure that you are not using any markdown format, and just provide the final answer as a single integer in the format \"Answer: XXX\" with no extra\u4fe1\u7528\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy.

So, we need to find out how many insects Lily found. The problem says that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Also, Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. \n\nFirst, let's denote the number of insects each person found. Let me use variables. Let me let D be the number of insects David found. Then, according to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found. So, if David found D insects, then Bodhi found twice as much as David. So, B = 2D. \n\nThen, Lily found 7 more than David. So, Lily's insects would be D + 7. \n\nSo, the total number of insects is Lily + David + Bodhi = (D + 7) + D + B. But B is 2D. So substituting that in, we get (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43. \n\nCombining like terms: D + 7 + D + 2D = 4D + 7 = 43. \n\nSo, 4", " Let me know if you need help.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many more years Lauren needs to work before she can retire, given that she saves 20% of her paycheck, her current salary is $100,000, and she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during her retirement period of 20 years.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Current Salary**: Lauren's current salary is $100,000 per year.\n\n2. **Savings Rate**: She saves 20% of her paycheck. That means she saves 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\n3. **Retirement Living Expenses**: She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.

He has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.\n\nNext, he ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. That means he ate 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie. So, the number of each type of cookie is now:\n\nOatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8\nChocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3\nSugar: 5 - 1 = 4\n\nThen, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, the oatmeal count is now 8 - 2 = 6.\n\nHe gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, sugar cookies are now 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nThen, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner.

So, the pot has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. That suggests that the total amount of soup is equivalent to either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. So, maybe the amount of soup is 4 units (adult bowls) or 8 units (child bowls), but the units are different. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's that the pot can hold 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. So the total quantity is 4 adult bowls, or 8 child bowls. But since the quantities are different, we can convert between them. So, for example, one adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls. Because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, so 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls. So, that's the conversion. So, that's the key point here.

So, one round trip is **2 * 100 yards = 200 yards**.\n- Blake runs this **15 times**.\n- So, total distance for Blake = **15 * 200 = 3000 yards**.\n\n#### Kelly:\n- Initially,", " integer number.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the entire match by breaking it down into two halves.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the first half:\n\n- Team A scores 4 goals.\n- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. So, Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n\nNext, let's look at the second half:\n\n- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\n- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores 8 / 4 = 2 goals in the second half.\n\nNow, we can sum up the goals scored by both teams in both halves:\n\n- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.\n- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 1", " words.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of each type of cookie Randy has at each step and then sum them up at the end to find the total number of cookies he has now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Count of Cookies**\n\nRandy starts with:\n\n- **Oatmeal cookies:** 9\n- **Chocolate chip cookies:** 4\n- **Sugar cookies:** 5\n\nTotal initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = **18 cookies**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: He Ate 3 Cookies for an Early Day Snack (One of Each Flavor)**\n\nHe ate 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie.\n\nNow, the counts are:\n\n- **Oatmeal:** 9 - 1 = **8**\n- **Chocolate chip:** 4 - 1 = **3**\n- **Sugar:** 5 - 1 = **4**\n\nTotal after this step = 8 + 3 + 4 = **15 cookies**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: He Ate 2 Oatmeal Cookies for Lunch**\n\nThis reduces the number of oatmeal cookies by 2.\n\n- **O", " \"Answer: XXX\"\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the capacity of the soup in terms of bowls. The problem states that the pot has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. This implies that the total amount of soup can be measured in terms of both adult and child bowls.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the capacity of one adult bowl as A and one child bowl as C. From the problem, we know:\n\n- 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls. So, 4A = 8C \u2192 A = 2C (since 4A = 8C \u2192 A = 8C / 4 = 2C)\n\nSo, an adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls in terms of soup volume.\n\nNow, let's determine how many bowls of soup are needed for the family. The family includes Calvin (adult), his wife (adult), and their two children.\n\n- Each adult eats one bowl, so 2 adult bowls (Calvin and wife).\n- Each child eats one bowl, so 2 child bowls.\n\nTotal number of bowls required:\n\n- Adult bowls: 2 (from adults)\n- Child", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird travels in the south and the total distance it travels north, and then find the difference between these two distances.  The difference will be the distance between the northern and southern homes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance the bird flies south initially: 30 miles per hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance the bird flies north: 18 miles per hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.\n\nThen, let's calculate the distance the bird flies south again: 22 miles per hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.\n\nNow, we need to find the net distance the bird has traveled from her northern home to her southern home.  This is the total distance flown south minus the total distance flown north.  However, we need to consider the direction of the bird's flight.  The bird first flew south 300 miles, then north 36 miles, and then south 110 miles.  The net distance would be 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance"], [" 15 minutes.\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance each person runs in 15 minutes and then find the difference between the two distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. Each trip back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is 15 trips * 200 yards per trip.\n\nNext, we calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once, then decides to run to the 40-yard line and back. This is a different distance. First, the initial trip back and forth is 100 yards (since she runs from the starting line to the 100-yard line and back). Then, she changes to running to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (40 yards each way). She does this 34 times. So, the total distance Kelly runs is (1 trip of 100 yards) + (34 trips of 80 yards).\n\nWe can", " to the problem.\n\n        Let's start by breaking down the problem into parts. First, let's figure out the goals scored in the first half. Team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so that's 4 minus 2, which is 2. So, in the first half, team A has 4 goals and team B has 2 goals. \n\n        Now, let's move on to the second half. The problem says that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. But it also states that team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. \n\n        First, let's calculate how many goals team B scores in the second half. In the first half, team B scored 2 goals. So, in the second half, team B scores 4 times that, which is 4 times 2, equaling 8 goals.\n\n        Now, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 8 goals in the second half, team A scores 1/4 of that, which is 8 divided by 4, equal", " words, and then as a single integer. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to track the number of cookies Randy has at each step of the day.

This implies that the total quantity of soup is equivalent to either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.\n   - Therefore, the total quantity of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.\n\n2. **Determine how much soup is used for the family:**\n   - There are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and their two children are not counted as adults, but the two children are not considered adults, so the three people who are adults are Calvin, his wife, and the two children are not considered adults. Wait, the problem states that Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. Therefore, there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and their two children? Wait no, the two children are children, not adults.

The distance for this leg is 10 * 30 = 300 miles.\n\nThen, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 mph. The distance for this leg is 2 * 18 = 36 miles.\n\nFinally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 mph. The distance for this leg is 5 * 22 = 110 miles.\n\nTotal distance flown south: 300 + 110 = 410 miles.\nTotal distance flown north: 36 miles.\nNet distance traveled south: 410 - 36 = 374 miles.\n\nThus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.\n\nAnswer: 374\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the steps again. The problem says the bird flies south for ", " times. So, we need to find the total distance each person ran and then find the difference between them.\n\n        First, let's calculate Blake's total distance. He runs back and forth 15 times. Each trip back and forth is 200 yards because he goes from one end to the other, which is 100 yards, and then back. So, for each back and forth, it's 100 yards * 2 = 200 yards. Therefore, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.\n\n        Now, let's calculate Kelly's total distance. She initially runs back and forth once, which is also 200 yards. Then, she changes her strategy. She now runs to the 40-yard line and back. That distance is 40 yards one way, so 80 yards back and forth. She does this 34 times. So, the first time she runs 200 yards, then 34 times 80 yards. Total for Kelly is 200 + 34 * 80.\n\n        Let me calculate that. 34 * ", "a.\nOkay, let's try to figure out this soccer match problem.

The problem is divided into two halves: the first half and the second half. \n\nIn the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Then, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. So, if team A scored 4, then team B scored 4 minus 2, which is 2 goals in the first half. Let me note that down:\n\nFirst half:\n- Team A: 4 goals\n- Team B: 4 - 2 = 2 goals\n\nNow, moving on to the second half. The problem says that in the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Also, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand that correctly.

This means that the amount of soup is equivalent to either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner. Calvin is an adult, and he is eating with his adult wife and their two children. That's a total of four people: 2 adults (Calvin and his wife) and 2 children. Each person will have one bowl of soup, so that's a total of 4 bowls.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. The problem is asking for the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup, which I think means how many bowls are left after everyone has had their meal.\n\nSo, first, we need to calculate how much soup is in the pot. If 4 adult bowls are equal to 8 child bowls, then each adult bowl is equal to 2 child", " \n\n        Note: The answer is the total distance the bird flew, not the straight line distance between the two homes.  The problem is designed to be solved with basic algebra and geometry, not with advanced concepts.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew, which is the sum of the distances she traveled in each leg of her journey. \n\nFirst, we calculate the distance for each leg of the trip:\n\n1. The first leg: The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The distance for this leg is speed multiplied by time, so 30 mph * 10 hours = 300 miles.\n\n2. The second leg: The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance for this leg is 18 mph * 2 hours = 36 miles.\n\n3. The third leg: The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance for this leg is 22 mph * 5 hours = 110 miles.\n\nTo find the total distance, we add the distances of each leg together: ", "://example.com.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how far each person runs in 15 minutes and then find the difference between the two distances.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup:\n\n- A football field is 100 yards long.\n- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.\n- Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides to run to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.\n\nNow, let's break down the distance each person runs.\n\n**Blake's Distance:**\n\n- Each back and forth run is a round trip from one end of the field to the other, which is 100 yards each way. So one round trip is 200 yards.\n- He does this 15 times, so his total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.\n\n**Kelly's Distance:**\n\n- Her first run is a back and forth run (from one end to the other), which is again 200 yards.\n- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back.

So, Team B's first half goals = 4 - 2 = 2 goals.\n\n**Second Half:**\n- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, Team B's second half goals = 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\n- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B. So, Team A's second half goals = (1/4) * 8 = 2 goals.\n\n**Total Goals:**\n- Team A's total goals = First half (4) + Second half (2) = 6 goals.\n- Team B's total goals = First half (2) + Second half (8) = 10 goals.\n- Total goals in the match = Team A's total (6) + Team B's total (10) = 16 goals.\n\nSo, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16.\n\nAnswer: ", " start with total cookies.

He has 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. So, the total is 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 9 + 4 is 13, plus 5 is 18. But that's the total, but then we have to consider that he ate some, gave some away, and baked more. But maybe the question is only asking for the total number of cookies he has now. Let me recheck.\n\nBut let's go step by step. First, initial total: 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, 5 sugar. Total cookies: 9 + 4 + 5 = 18. But wait, no. Wait, that's the total. Then he ate 3 cookies for a snack: one of each flavor.

Then, we need to determine how many bowls are left after they all eat, and specifically how many times each child can have a bowl of soup from the leftover.\n\nFirst, let's understand the total number of bowls of soup that can be filled from the pot. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. So, we can think of this as a proportion problem where 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls. That means each adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (since 8 child bowls divided by 4 adult bowls is 2).\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of people eating. Calvin is an adult, his wife is also an adult, and their two children are children. That makes 2 adults and 2 children, totaling 4 people.\n\nEach person needs one bowl of soup. So, the total number of bowls needed is 4 bowls.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much of the pot is used for these 4 bowls.

So the bird is traveling from her northern home to her southern home. The question is asking for the distance between these two homes. The bird makes three legs of the journey: first flying south for 10 hours at 30 mph, then turning north for 2 hours at 18 mph, and finally flying south again for 5 hours at 22 mph. \n\nHmm, so I need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each direction and then figure out the net displacement. Wait, but the problem is about the distance between the two homes, which is the straight-line distance. However, since the bird is moving back and forth, maybe I need to compute the net distance from the starting point? Or is it the total distance? Wait, no. The question is about the distance between the northern and southern homes. So, the bird starts at the north, goes south, then north, then south again, and ends up at the southern home. So", "\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how much farther the winner ran than the loser in the contest. We are given that Blake and Kelly each ran a certain number of times back and forth on a football field that is 100 yards long. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the distances each person runs\n\n#### **Blake's run**\nBlake runs **back and forth** 15 times. Each trip from one end to the other is a full length of the field: 100 yards. So, each round trip (back and forth) is:\n\n$$\n100 \\text{ yards} \\times 2 = 200 \\text{ yards}\n$$\n\nHe does this 15 times, so total distance Blake runs:\n\n$$\n15 \\times 200 = 3000 \\text{ yards}\n$$\n\n---\n\n#### **Kelly's run**\nKelly runs **back and forth once**, and then changes her strategy.\n\n- First, she runs **back and forth once**: that\u2019s the same as Blake\u2019s 200 yards (100 yards each way).\n\n- Then she decides to run **"], ["\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the entire match. The problem can be broken down into two parts: the first half and the second half.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the first half. The problem states that in the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. Since team A scores 4 goals, team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n\nNext, we move on to the second half. The problem states that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. Additionally, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\n\nNow, we can find out how many goals team A scores in the second half. The problem states that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. Since team B scores 8 goals in the second half, team A scores (1/4) *", " start with the initial total number of cookies. Then, subtract the ones he ate and gave away. Then add the ones he baked. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the initial total number of cookies. He has 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. So, 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies. \n\nNext, he ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. That means he ate 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie. So, subtracting those from the total: 18 - 3 = 15 cookies left.\n\nThen, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, subtract 2 from the current total: 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.\n\nHe gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, subtract 2 from the current total: 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left.\n\nThen, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. That means he bakes 4 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 4 sugar cookies. So, adding those to the current total", " proportions problem.\n\n        So the total number of bowls is 4 adults or 8 children. So that means 4 adult bowls = 8 children bowls. Therefore, 1 adult bowl equals 2 children bowls.\n\n        The family includes Calvin (adult), his wife (adult), and two children. That's 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 people. Since each person needs a bowl, that's 4 bowls. So the total bowls needed is 4.\n\n        The total soup is enough for 4 adult bowls or 8 children bowls. So, how many bowls is that? 4 adult bowls or 8 children bowls. So if we consider that each adult bowl is 2 children bowls, then 4 adult bowls would be 8 children bowls. So the soup can serve 8 children bowls, or 4 adult bowls.\n\n        The family is eating 4 bowls, which is the same as 8 children bowls. So that means the soup is just enough for the family, and there's no leftover. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n        But that seems too straightforward.

The bird is flying in different directions, so I can't just add up the distances. I need to consider the net displacement.\n\nFirst, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 mph, which is 300 miles south.\n\nThen, it flies north for 2 hours at 18 mph, which is 36 miles north.\n\nThen, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 mph, which is", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance each person runs in 15 minutes and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Blake's running. He runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. A back-and-forth run covers twice the length of the field (to the end and back), so each run is 100 * 2 = 200 yards. Therefore, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.\n\nNext, let's analyze Kelly's running. She initially runs back and forth once, which is also 200 yards, but then she changes her route to running to the 40-yard line and back. This new route is 40 * 2 = 80 yards per run. She does this 34 times, so the distance for these runs is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial run, her total distance is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.\n\nNow, we compare the total distances.

Team B scored 2 in the first half, so in the second half, Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\n\nTeam A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Team B scored 8 in the second half, so Team A scores 8 / 4 = 2 goals in the second half.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total goals scored by each team in the match.\n\nTeam A's total goals = first half goals + second half goals = 4 + 2 = 6 goals.\n\nTeam B's total goals = first half goals + second half goals = 2 + 8 = 10 goals.\n\nStep 4: Add the total goals of both", " words, then the final answer as a single integer in the format \"Answer: XXX\" with no extra formatting.\nOkay, let's see. Randy has different types of cookies. I need to figure out how many he has now after all these actions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial counts: 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. So total cookies at first are 9 + 4 + 5. Let me check that again: 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate, 5 sugar. Yeah, that's 9+4=13, plus 5 is 18. But maybe I don't need the total right away.\n\nHe ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So that's one oatmeal, one chocolate chip, and one sugar cookie. So he ate 1 of each. So now, the counts would be:\n\nOatmeal: 9 -1 = 8\n\nChocolate chip: 4 -1 = 3\n\nSugar cookies: 5 -1 = 4\n\nThen, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So oatmeal now is 8 -2", " \".\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup from the leftover soup after Calvin and his family have eaten their portions.\n\nFirst, we'll figure out how much soup there is in total. The problem says the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. So, we can consider that the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. This means that the total soup is the same whether measured in adult bowls or child bowls.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much soup is used by Calvin and his family. Calvin is an adult, and he will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. That makes a total of 3 adults and 2 children. \n\nAssuming each adult eats one bowl and each child eats one bowl, the total number of bowls consumed by the family is:\n\n3 adults * 1 bowl each + 2 children * 1 bowl each = 3 + 2 = 5 bowls.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much soup is left after these 5 bowls have been consumed. The total soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. So, we need"], [" \n\n        Also, please make sure that the answer is correct.

The problem is about the bird traveling from her northern home to her southern home, and we need to find the distance between the two homes.  The bird makes three legs of the journey, each with different directions and speeds.  So, the total distance between the two homes will be the sum of the distances flown in the south direction minus the distances flown in the north direction.  Wait, but the problem is asking for the distance between the two homes, so maybe we need to find the net displacement of the bird.  Because the bird is going south, then north, then south again.  So the total displacement will be the net distance from the starting point (northern home) to the ending point (southern home).  So the answer is the net displacement.  Therefore, we need to calculate the net displacement.  So, the bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 mph.  So that's 30", "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "\n        So, first, let's break down the problem into parts.\n\n        First half:\n        - Team A scores 4 goals.\n        - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. So that would be 4 - 2 = 2 goals for Team B in the first half.\n\n        Second half:\n        - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.\n        - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.

The problem is about proportion and division. The problem is not about equal amounts of soup, but about the proportions. So the answer is based on the idea that the total amount of soup is equivalent to four adult bowls or eight child's bowls. So the total amount of soup is equal to four adult bowls or eight child bowls. So, the total amount is 4A = 8C, where A is the amount of soup in an adult bowl and C is the amount of soup in a child's bowl. So, 4A = 8C => A = 2C. So, the adult bowl is twice as large as the child's bowl. Now, the number of people eating is: Calvin (adult), his wife (adult), and their two children. So that's 2 adults and 2 children. So, total bowls needed is 2A + 2C. But the total amount of soup is 4A or 8C. So, the question is: how many times can each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?\n\nWait, the problem says \"how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for", " \n\n        For example, if the answer were 10, you would write \"Answer: 10\".\n        Do not put any other text.\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a bird traveling from its northern home to a southern home. I need to find the distance between the two homes. The bird makes three legs of the journey, each with different directions and speeds. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the distance the bird travels in each leg. Then, since the bird is moving back and forth, I need to determine the net displacement. The total distance between the homes would be the net displacement, right? Because the bird starts at the north home, goes south, then north, then south again, and ends up at the southern home. So the net displacement should be the total distance from the north home to the south home.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst leg: The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 mph.

That's 15*200 = 3000 yards.\n\nFor Kelly: She initially runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she changes her plan and runs to the 40-yard line and back. That's 80 yards each way (40 yards to the line and 40 back), so each round trip is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, the distance from the new plan is 34 times 80 yards. That's 34*80 = 2720 yards. But wait, she did one run initially, which is 200 yards, and then 34 times 80 yards.
