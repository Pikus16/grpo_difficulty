The two options are eating Cheerios every day or eating donuts every day. \n\nThe first thing I need to do is figure out the weight change per week for each option and then multiply that by 5 weeks to get the total weight change over 5 weeks. Then, subtract the two total weight changes to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the Cheerios: he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, that would be 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks. Let me calculate that: 1.25 * 5. 1.25 times 5 is 6.25 pounds. So, eating Cheerios would result in a weight loss of 6.25 pounds over 5 weeks.\n\nNow for the donuts: he gains 1.75 pounds per week. So over 5 weeks, that's 1.75 * 5. Let me compute that. 1.75 times 5 is 8.75 pounds.

The third zebra has 36 stripes, and the fourth has half that many, which is 18 stripes. Adding these together: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88. There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 \u00f7 4 = 22. The average number of stripes is 22.\nAnswer: 22\n\nWait, the problem says \"two zebras with 17 stripes each,\" \"a zebra with 36 stripes,\" and \"another zebra with half that many stripes.\" That's 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 zebras.

Each group can have 8 students, so we divide 10 by 8 to get the number of groups needed per grade. This gives us 10 \u00f7 8 = 1.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2 groups.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weight change for each option:\n\nFor Cheerios: Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, that's 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds lost.\n\nFor Donuts: Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, that's 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds gained.\n\nNow, to find the difference between the two options, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain: 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is 2.5 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 2.5 pounds, which is a single integer when expressed as a whole number, but since 2.5 is a decimal, the answer would be 2.5.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately.  For the petunias, each one costs $3.00, so 15 * 3 = $45.00.  For the sweet potato vines, each one costs $2.50, so 10 * 2.50 = $25.00.  Then, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.\n\n        Answer: 70\nAnswer: 70", " \n\n        For example: Answer: 24\n\n        Think carefully:\n\nStep 1: Find the total number of stripes for all zebras. \n\nStep 2: Divide the total by the number of zebras.\n\nOkay, let's see. Jane is counting zebras and their stripes. The problem says she counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. So I need to find the average number of stripes per zebra.\n\nFirst, let me figure out how many zebras there are in total. The problem mentions two zebras with 17 stripes each, then a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many. Let me count the number of zebras. The first two are separate, then another one, so total is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 zebras. Wait, two zebras with 17 stripes each, then a third zebra with 36, and a fourth with half that.

That means they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.\n\nNext, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club. Since the glee club ordered 20, the football team ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. 80% is 0.8, so 40 * 0.8 = 32. So, the football team ate 32 pizzas.

Since 8 students can go at a time, we divide the 10 students by 8 to see how many sessions are needed per grade. \n\n10 \u00f7 8 = 1.25\n\nThis means that for each grade, we need 1 full session of 8 students, and then a second session of 2 students (since 10 - 8 = 2). So, each grade will take 2 sessions.\n\nNow, each session is 45 minutes, so 2 sessions would take 2 \u00d7 45 minutes = 90 minutes.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that there are multiple grades involved.

He was closed on Monday and Friday. So, the days he was open are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend. However, the problem says \"over the weekend he sold 20 crates.\" It's a bit ambiguous, but typically, a weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So, assuming that the weekend is Saturday and Sunday, he sold 20 crates on the weekend. Then, on Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12, and on Thursday 18. \n\n        So, the total number of crates sold is 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday). Let's add those up. 20 + 15 is 35, plus 12 is 47, plus 18 is 65. So Sam sold 65 crates in total. \n\n        His target was 120 crates.

Each cell phone costs $150, so for five phones, the total cost is:\n\n$$ 5 \\times 150 = 750 $$\n\nNext, we account for the 2% interest charged on each unit. Since the interest is applied per unit, we need to compute the total interest first. The total amount to be paid includes the original cost plus the interest. The interest is 2% of the total cost:\n\n$$ 2\\% \\text{ of } 750 = 0.02 \\times 750 = 15 $$\n\nAdding this interest to the original cost gives the total amount Shiela has to pay:\n\n$$ 750 + 15 = 765 $$\n\nNow, Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months in installments.

Katarina has 68 cookies.\n\nLet's start by figuring out the number of cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less than Max and she has 68 cookies, we can set up the equation:\n\nKatarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5  \n68 = Max's cookies - 5  \nSo, Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73\n\nNow that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more than the Cookie Monster:\n\nMax's cookies = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12  \n73 = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12  \nCookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12 = 61\n\nNext, let's find out how many"], [" Let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we can calculate 0.7 * 20 = 14. So the glee club ate 14 pizzas.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pizzas the football team ordered. The problem says they ordered twice as many as the glee club. Since the glee club ordered 20 pizzas, the football team ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.\n\nNow, we calculate how many pizzas the football team ate. They ate 80% of their ordered pizzas. So 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.\n\nTo find out how many pizzas are left in total, we first find out how many each group had left and then add them together. \n\nFor the glee club, they ordered 20 and ate 14, so they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.\n\nFor the football team, they ordered 40 and ate 32, so they", " Do not use markdown, and make sure to put the answer in the box.\n\n        Let's see.

For donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. \n\nSo, over 5 weeks, the total weight change would be different for each option. \n\nLet me calculate the total weight loss if he eats Cheerios for 5 weeks. That would be 1.25 pounds/week multiplied by 5 weeks. Let me do that math: 1.25 * 5. Hmm, 1.25 times 5 is 6.25 pounds.

Since there are 5 baskets, that would be 3 multiplied by 5. Let me calculate that: 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. \n\nThen, for the sweet potato vines, each basket has 2 of them. So again, multiply 2 by 5 baskets: 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines.\n\nNow, the cost for each petunia is $3.00, so 15 petunias would cost 15 * 3.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have two zebras with 17 stripes each. That's 2 times 17. Then there's a zebra with 36 stripes. The next zebra has half that many stripes, so half of 36 is 18. Now we add all these up: 2*17, 36, and 18. Let's calculate that. 2*17 is 34, plus 36 is 70, plus 18 is 88. Now, we have four zebras in total (2 + 1 + 1). To find the average, we divide the total stripes by the number of zebras. 88 divided by 4 is 22. So the average is 22.\n\nAnswer: 22\n\nThe problem involves calculating the average number of stripes per zebra.

Let me check the details again.\n\nCedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 \u2013 7. That means 4 grades. Each grade has 10 students with the most points. So, 4 grades \u00d7 10 students = 40 students in total.\n\nEach group can have 8 students. So, the total number of groups needed is 40 students \u00f7 8 students per group = 5 groups.\n\nIf each group uses their full 45 minutes, then the total time needed is 5 groups \u00d7 45 minutes = 225 minutes.\n\nBut wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about", " Do not provide any other explanations.\n\n        The total number of crates he sold is 20 (Saturday) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65.

For example, the word \"each\" in \"five cell phones for $150 each\". So, the total price for five cell phones is 5 x 150 = $750. But the problem says \"for a 3-month installment\", so is the 2% interest charged for each unit? That is, for each cell phone? So, 2% interest for each cell phone, which would be 2% of $150 per unit? That is, 2% of 150 is $3 per unit. So, total interest is 5 x 3 = $15. So total amount to be paid is 750 + 15 = /content/math/765. Then, the total amount is divided into 3 installments. So, 765 divided by 3 = 255. So, each month payment is $255. \n\n        But maybe the question is intended to say that the 2% interest is for each month, so for each unit, 2% is charged per month, but then that would be a", " Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n        First, we can define the number of cookies that each person has.

So, K = M - 5.\n\n        Then, Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, M = C + 12.\n\n        Then, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, S = M + 23.\n\n        We are told that Katarina has 68 cookies. So, K = 68.\n\n        Now, using the first equation, we can plug in K = 68. That gives us 68 = M - 5. So, solving for M, we get M = 68 + 5 = 73.\n\n        Now that we know M is 73, we can plug that into the second equation to find C. M = C + 12, so 73 = C + 12.

That means they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.\n\nNext, let's look at the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club. The glee club ordered 20, so twice that is 40 pizzas. The football team ate 80% of them. To find out how many that is, we calculate 80% of 40. 80% is 0.8 in decimal form. So 0.8 multiplied by 40 equals 32. That means the football team ate 32 pizzas.

Half of 36 is 18, so that's 18 stripes.\n\nNow, adding them all up: 34 (from the first two) + 36 (third zebra) + 18 (fourth zebra) = 34 + 36 = 70, then 70 + 18 = 88 total stripes.\n\nThere are 4 zebras in total (2 + 1 + 1). To find the average, divide total stripes by number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.\n\nSo, the average number of stripes per zebra is 2", " \n\n        For example: Answer: 123\n    Step 1: Determine how many groups are needed. There are 10 students in each grade with the most points. Since there are 4 grades (4th to 7th), that's 10 students per grade \u00d7 4 grades = 40 students total.\n\n    Step 2: Figure out how many students can try at a time. The problem says only 8 students can try at a time.\n\n    Step 3: Divide the total number of students by the number that can try at a time. 40 \u00f7 8 = 5 groups.\n\n    Step 4: Multiply the number of groups by the time per group. 5 groups \u00d7 45 minutes = 225 minutes.\n\n    So the answer is 225 minutes.\n\n    Answer: 225\n\nWait, let me check that again. The problem says \"every group uses their full 45 minutes\". So if there are 5 groups, each taking 45 minutes, that would be 5 \u00d7 45 = 225 minutes total.

Then on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he sold 15, 12, and 18 crates, respectively. \n\n        So, the total number of crates sold is 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates. \n\n        But wait, the week is from Monday to Sunday. If he was closed on Monday and Friday, then the days he was open were Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. \n\n        So the total number of crates sold is 20 (Saturday and Sunday) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates. \n\n        Sam's target was 120 crates.

The answer might be different depending on the interest calculation method. However, we'll use the simple interest formula for this solution.\n    \n    Solution:\n    \n    First, let's find the total cost of the cell phones before any interest. Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each, so the total cost is 5 * 150 = 750 dollars.\n    \n    Next, we need to calculate the interest. The problem says a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. This might be a bit ambiguous, but we'll assume it's a simple interest rate on the total amount.\n    \n    The simple interest formula is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time.\n    \n    Here, the principal is $750, the rate is 2% (or 0.02), and the time is 3 months.

The problem states that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Therefore, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. \n\nNext, we are told that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. To find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, we subtract 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.\n\nThen, we are told that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find out how many cookies Summer has, we add 23 to Max's total: 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n\nNow, we can add up all the cookies each person has: Katarina (68) + Max (73) + Cookie Monster (61) + Summer (96) = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96. \n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\nFirst, add 68 and "], [" Make sure that the answer is correct and the reasoning is solid.

To find 70% of 20, we can calculate 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas. So the glee club ate 14 pizzas, meaning they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.\n\n        Next, let's figure out how many pizzas the football team ordered. It says the football team ordered twice as many as the glee club. The glee club ordered 20, so the football team ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.\n\n        Now, we need to find out how many of those 40 pizzas the football team ate. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

For Cheerios: Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:\n   1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds.\n\n2. For donuts: Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:\n   1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds.\n\nNext, we find the difference between the two scenarios. The difference in weight is the weight gain from donuts minus the weight loss from Cheerios:\n   8.75 pounds (gain) - 6.25 pounds (loss) = 2.5 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and eating Cheerios is 2.5 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 2.5 pounds, which can be represented as", " So, for example, if the answer were 10, you would say \"Answer: 10\".\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for Katherine to fill all 5 hanging baskets with the specified plants.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of each type of plant needed for one basket.

Since she has 5 baskets, we multiply these numbers by 5:\n\n- For petunias: 3 per basket \u00d7 5 baskets = 15 petunias\n- For sweet potato vines: 2 per basket \u00d7 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines\n\nNext, we calculate the cost for each type of plant:\n\n- The cost for 15 petunias is 15 \u00d7 $3.00 = $45.00\n- The cost for 10 sweet potato vines is 10 \u00d7 $2.50 = $25.00\n\nFinally, we add the two costs together to get the total amount Katherine will spend:\n\n$45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $", " Do not write any explanation. \n\n        For example, if the answer is 100, write \"Answer: 100\".\n\n        First, we need to find the total number of stripes on all the zebras and then divide by the number of zebras to find the average.\n\n        Step 1: Calculate the total number of stripes for the first two zebras. Each has 17 stripes, so 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.\n        \n        Step 2: The third zebra has 36 stripes. The fourth zebra has half that many, so 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\n        \n        Step 3: Add up all the stripes: 34 (from the first two) + 36 (third zebra) + 18 (fourth zebra) = 98.\n        \n        Step 4: There are 4 zebras in total. So, the average number of stripes per zebra is 98 / 4 = 24.5.\n        \n        Step 5: Since we're dealing with whole numbers of stripes, it's possible that the average is not a whole number.

Since each group can have 8 students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group. However, since 10 is not a multiple of 8, we will need to round up to the next whole number to ensure that all students get a chance to try the escape room.\n\nSo, 10 students divided by 8 students per group is 1.25, which means we need 2 groups to accommodate all 10 students. Each group takes 45 minutes, so 2 groups would take 2 * 45 = 90 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time required for everyone to try the escape room is 90 minutes.\nAnswer: 90\n\nLet's verify the", " Please reason carefully, and make sure you are not missing any steps. \n\n        Let me try to work through this problem step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many crates Sam actually sold during the week and then compare that to his target of 120 crates. \n\nThe problem says he was closed on Monday and Friday.

So if Max has 73, then the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.\n\nThen, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So Summer's total would be 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n\nNow, to find the total number of cookies all of them have, I need to add up Katarina's, Max's, the Cookie Monster's, and Summer's cookies.\n\nSo that's 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = ?\n\nLet me calculate that: 68 + 73 is 141.

We need to find out how many of them are chickens.\n\nFirst, let me recall that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. So, if I let the number of chickens be C and the number of cows be W, then I can set up equations based on the total number of animals and the total number of legs.\n\nSo, the total number of animals is 20. Therefore, C + W = 20.\n\nFor the legs, chickens contribute 2 legs each, and cows contribute 4 legs each.

So, each boy brought 60 shells. Therefore, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 boys * 60 shells each = 600 shells.\n\nNow, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

However, since we need an integer, we might have to round it or consider if there's a different interpretation. But since the problem says \"how high does the ball go on its second bounce,\" and given that each bounce is 2/3 of the previous height, the exact value is 10 and 2/3 feet. But the question might require an exact answer in fraction form or a decimal. However, the instructions say to provide the answer as a single integer. This suggests that maybe the answer should be in fraction form, but the problem says \"Answer: XXX\" with an integer. There's a contradiction here.

First, simplify the second equation by dividing by 2: $ c + 2w = 35 $.\n\nThen, subtract the first equation from this simplified equation: $ (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20 $, which gives $ w = 15 $.\n\nSubstituting $ w = 15 $ back into the first equation: $ c + 15 = 20 $, so $ c = 5 $.\n\nTherefore, there are 5", "-step and then final answer.\n\n        Let me try to work through this problem step by step.\n\n        First, I need to figure out the relationship between Wendy's current age and Colin's current age.\n\n        Let me denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.\n\n        The first part of the problem says: \"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.\" \n\n        So, seven years from now, Colin will be C + 7 years old. Therefore, Wendy's current age is five times that. So, W = 5*(C + 7).\n\n        The second part of the problem says: \"In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.\"\n\n        In 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. Wendy is now W years old. So, according to the problem, C + 25 = (1/3)*W.\n\n        Now I have two equations:\n\n        1. W = 5*(C + 7)\n        2.

Tanya's earnings depend on two factors: her hourly rate and a daily bonus if she teaches more than 3 classes. We need to calculate her earnings for two days: Monday and Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since 4 classes is more than 3, she gets the additional $5 per day. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since 2 classes is less than 3, she doesn't get the bonus.\n\nLet's calculate for each day.\n\nFor Monday:\n- Earnings from hours: 5 hours * $15 per hour = $75\n- Bonus for teaching more than 3 classes: $5\n- Total for Monday: $75 + $5 = $80\n\nFor Wednesday:\n- Earnings from hours: 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30\n- No bonus (since 2 classes < 3)\n- Total for Wednesday: $30\n\nNow, add the earnings from both days:\n- Monday: $80\n- Wednesday: $30\n- Total: $8", " \n\n        Also, please make sure that the answer is correct. So, let's check the problem again. First, find out how many boys and girls there are. The total number of kids is 20. They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, that would be 10 boys and 10 girls. Then, the boys each brought back 60 shells. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing here. Let me parse it again. \n\n        \"the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys\". So, is that the girls' amount equal to (boys' amount) + 4*(boys' amount)? Or is it that the girls' amount is equal to (boys' amount) + (four times as many as the boys' amount)? Either way, it seems like it's 60 + 4*60? But that would be 60 + 240 = 300 shells per girl? But that seems like", " first bounce, then second bounce. So, on the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of the first height, and then on the second bounce, it reaches 2/3rds of that height. So, the total height on the second bounce would be the initial height multiplied by (2/3)^2. Let's calculate that.\n\nInitial height is 3rd floor, which is 3 stories high. 3 stories times 24 feet per story is 72 feet. Then, (2/3)^2 is 4/9. Multiply that by 72 feet. 4/9 * 72 = 32 feet. So the answer is 32.\n\nThe answer is 32.\n\nAnother way to look at it is by calculating each bounce step-by-step. First, the initial drop from the third floor is 3 * 24 = 72 feet. After the first bounce, it reaches 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet. Then, after the second bounce, it reaches 48 * (2/3) = 32 feet.

The problem says that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. Let me write this as an equation. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C. \n\nSo, seven years from now, Colin will be C + 7 years old. According to the problem, Wendy's current age is five times that, so W = 5*(C + 7). That's the first equation.\n\nThe second part of the problem says that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. In 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. Wendy is now W years old. So, the second equation is C + 25 = (1/3)*W. \n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. W = 5*(C + 7)\n2. C + 25 = (1/3)*W\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find the value of C, which is Colin's current age. Let me substitute", " calculate step by step.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate Tanya's earnings for both Monday and Wednesday separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her earnings for Monday:\n\n- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. \n- The hourly rate is $15. So, for the hours, it's 5 hours * $15/hour = $75.\n- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, which is more than 3, she gets an additional $5. So, the total for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.\n\nNext, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:\n\n- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. \n- Again, the hourly rate is $15. So, for the hours, it's 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.\n- Now, we check if she qualifies for the additional $5 per day. She teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so she doesn't get the additional $5. Therefore, her total for Wednesday is $30.\n\nNow", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought.

So, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.\n\nThen, the problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This part is a bit tricky. Let's parse it carefully.\n\nThe phrase \"the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys\" can be interpreted as:\n\nTotal shells brought by girls = (number of shells brought by boys) + 4 * (number of shells brought by boys)\n\nSo, substituting the known values:\n\nTotal shells brought by girls = 600 + 4 * 600 = 60"], [" 0\nAnswer: 64\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\nThe first bounce is from the third-floor balcony. The third floor is 24 feet high. So, the initial drop is 24 feet. After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of that height, which is (2/3)*24 = 16 feet. After the second bounce, it reaches 2/3rds of the previous height, so (2/3)*16 = 10.666... feet. However, the question is asking for the height on the second bounce, which is the height after the second bounce, not the first. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when they say \"second bounce,\" does that mean the second time it bounces up? The first bounce is when it hits the ground after the initial drop. The first bounce is the first time it goes up. Then, the second bounce is the second time it goes up. So the first bounce is 2/3 of the initial height, the second is 2/3 of that, etc. So starting from 24 feet, first bounce is 2", "'ted, but I need to find out how many people actually show up. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total number of people Martha invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, for the first part, 2 families times 6 people per family is 12 people. Then for the 3 families with 4 people each, that's 3 times 4, which is 12. Adding those together, 12 plus 12 is 24. So Martha invited 24 people in total.\n\nNext, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So that means 8 people are not attending. But then there's also 1/4 of that number (the 8) who had previous commitments. So 1/4 of 8 is 2. So 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come. Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 plus 2, which is 10.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous", " step-by-step, then end with \"Answer: XXX\" with the correct number in the format specified.\n\nStep 1: Let's assume that all 20 animals are chickens. If that's the case, how many legs would there be? Well, chickens have 2 legs each, so 20 chickens would have 20 * 2 = 40 legs. However, we know that there are 70 legs in total, which is 30 legs more than if they were all chickens.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to figure out how many of these animals are cows instead of chickens, since cows have 4 legs. Each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken. So, if we replace a chicken with a cow, we add 2 legs to the total. Since we need 30 more legs, we can divide 30 by 2 to find out how many cows there are. 30 / 2 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 cows.\n\nStep 3: Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can subtract that from the total number of animals to find out how many are chickens. 20 total", " age word problem.\n\nLet's solve this step by step. \n\nFirst, let's define the variables.

So, Wendy's current age is five times that. Therefore:\n\nW = 5*(C + 7)   [Equation 1]\n\n2. \"In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.\"\n\nIn 25 years, Colin's age will be C + 25. According to the problem, this is a third of Wendy's current age. So:\n\nC + 25 = (1/3)*W   [Equation 2]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\nEquation 1: W = 5*(C + 7)\nEquation 2: C + 25 = (1/3)*W\n\nWe can substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1, W = 5C + 3", " Calculate her earnings for each day and sum them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday.\n\nOn Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.

Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (which is 600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys. \n\nWait, the wording is: \"the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys\".

Then, it falls back down, hits the ground again, and then bounces up to 2/3 of 16 feet, which is 10.666... feet. So the second bounce would be 10.666... feet. But since the answer needs to be an integer, maybe we need to round it, but that seems odd. Or maybe there's a different way.

She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, for the first part, 2 families times 6 people each. That would be 2*6=12 people. Then, for the 3 families with 4 people each, that's 3*4=12 people. Adding those two together, 12 + 12 = 24 people total invited.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the problem says \"2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.\" So, that's 2 families times 6 people each and 3 families times 4 people each. So, 2*6=12, 3*4=12. 12+12=24.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. We need to find out how many of these animals are chickens.\n\nLet's start by recalling that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Let me define variables to represent the unknowns. Let me use C for the number of chickens and W for the number of cows.\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on the information given:\n\n1. C + W = 20 (since there are 20 animals in total)\n2. 2C + 4W = 70 (since chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express one variable in terms of the other.

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, she gets the additional $5 per day. \n\nSo for Monday:\n- Hourly earnings: 5 hours * $15 = $75\n- Additional daily earnings: $5\n- Total for Monday: $75 + $5 = $80\n\nNow for Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Again, she earns $15 per hour.

So, the total shells brought by the girls is equal to the boys' shells plus four times the boys' shells. So, the girls' total is 5 times the boys' total. \n\n        So, first, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in each group. There are 20 kids, split equally into two groups, so that would be 10 boys and 10 girls. \n\n        Then, the boys each brought 60 shells. So, boys' total is 10 * 60 = 600 shells. \n\n        The girls' total is 5 times that, which is 5 * 600 = 3000 shells. \n\n        Then, to find how many shells each girl brought, divide 300\u062d\u0645 by the number of girls, which is 10. \n\n        3000 / 10 = ", "'s height is 24 feet.

Second bounce is 2/3 * 16 = 32/3 feet. Convert that to a mixed number: 32/3 = 10 2/3 feet. The question is asking for the height on the second bounce, so the answer is 10 2/3 feet.

In other words:\n\nW = 5 * (C + 7)\n\nThat's our first equation.\n\nNow, let's parse the second sentence: \"In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.\" So, in 25 years, Colin\u2019s age will be (C + 25), and this is equal to one-third of Wendy's current age. Therefore:\n\nC + 25 = (1/3) * W\n\nThat's our second equation.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. W = 5*(C + 7)\n2.

So, total for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. The hourly rate is $15, so for the hours, it would be 2 hours * $15 = $30. She teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so no additional $5. So, total for Wednesday is $30.\n\nAdding both days, $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.\n\nTherefore, Tanya earned a total of $110 for these two days of teaching.\n\nAnswer: 110\nAnswer: 110\n\nLet's go through the problem step-by-step to find out how much Tanya earned for the two days.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Tanya", " For example, if the answer was 3, you'd put \"Answer: 3\".\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought.

So, the number of girls is 20 / 2 = 10 and the number of boys is also 10.\n\n2. **Shells brought by boys**: Each boy brought back 60 shells. Therefore, the total number of shells brought by all the boys is 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.\n\n3. **Shells brought by girls**: The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This is a bit tricky. Let's parse it carefully:\n   - \"The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys\" \u2014 This means the girls brought 600 shells (same as the boys).\n   - \"plus four times as many se", "First bounce height: 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet. Second bounce height: 2/3 * 16 = 10.666... feet. Answer: 10.666...\n\nBut that's not an integer. Wait, maybe the problem expects an exact fraction? Let me check the calculation again.\n\nFirst bounce: 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet. Second bounce: 2/3 * 16 = 32/3 = 10 and 2/3 feet. So as an exact value, it's 32/3 feet. But the problem says to provide the answer as a single integer. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The question says \"how high does the ball go on its second bounce?\" So the first bounce is when it hits the ground and bounces up to 2/3 of the previous height. The second bounce is the height after the first bounce. So the first drop is 24 feet. Then the first bounce is 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet. Then the second bounce", "'t have to think about it. The answer is 50. But let's go through it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of people invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So that's (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 12 + 12 = 24 people.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of people who couldn't come due to illness. It's given as 8 people.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of people who had previous commitments. It's 1/4 of the number that couldn't come due to illness. That's 8 * (1/4) = 2 people.\n\nStep 4: Subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited. Total people who showed up = 24 - 8 - 2 = 14. Wait, but this doesn't match the initial answer. It seems there's a mistake here.\n\nBut the original answer was 50, which suggests that perhaps the initial calculations are wrong. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait", " Step-by-step: Step 1: Let C be the number of chickens and C be the number of cows. Step 2: The total number of animals is C + C = 20. Step 3: The total number of legs is 2C + 4C = 70. Step 4: Simplify the equation. Step 5: Solve for C. Step 6: Answer the question.\n\n        Alright, let's try to solve this problem step by step. \n\n        First, the problem says there are 20 animals on the farm, and they are either chickens or cows. So, we need to figure out how many chickens there are. \n\n        Let me think. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W (for cows). That makes sense because we need two variables here. So, the first equation is C + W = 20. That's straightforward, since the total number of animals is 20.\n\n        Now, for the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 70. So, the second equation would be 2C + ", " age algebra word problem.\n\nLet me solve this step by step. First, I need to set up the equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.\n\nFrom the first statement: \"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.\"\n\nSeven years from now, Colin will be C + 7 years old. So Wendy's current age is five times that. So:\n\nW = 5*(C + 7)\n\nFrom the second statement: \"In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.\"\n\nIn 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. And this is a third of Wendy's current age. So:\n\nC + 25 = (1/3)*W\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. W = 5*(C + 7)\n2. C + 25 = (1/3)*W\n\nNow substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nC + 25 = (1/3)*(5*(C + 7))\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3*(C + 2", " calculate it step by step, then write the answer.\n\n        For example, if the answer is $20, write \"Answer: 20\".\n\n        Do not write any other explanation, just the final answer as a single integer in the format \"Answer: XXX\".\n\n        To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday separately and then add them together.\n\n        First, let's calculate her earnings for Monday. She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. The hourly rate is $15, so for the hours, that's 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she teaches more than 3 classes (4 classes), so she gets an additional $5 per day. So her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.\n\n        Now, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. The hourly rate is $15, so for the hours, that's 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, which is less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not receive the additional $5. So her", " The answer must be in the box. Please reason through the problem step by step and then put the final answer in the box.\n\n        So, the problem is:\n\n        There are 20 kids on a school trip. They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So that means 10 girls and 10 boys. Then, the boys went out for a scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, how many seashells were brought by each girl?\n\n        Let's break it down:\n\n        First, find out how many girls and boys there are. Since there are 20 kids and they are divided into two equal groups, that means 10 girls and 10 boys.\n\n        Then, we know the boys each brought 60 shells. So, each boy brought 60 shells. The problem says the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n\n        Wait, the wording here is a bit confusing.
