Then, there's another condition: 5% of the more dangerous candles (so, the ones that are dangerous, i.e., explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, we need to find out how many candles are both exploding and smell like wet dog. \n\n        Let me break it down. First, total number of candles is 50,000. The first part is that 99% are not exploded. So, 1% explode. So, the number of exploding candles is 50,000 * 1% = 500. Then, 5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., those that explode) have the wet dog smell. So, out of these 500 exploding candles, 5% are defective with wet dog smell. So, 5% of 500 is 25.

Therefore, the number of hours she needs to sell all 36 cups is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the profit per hour. Profit is total revenue minus total cost.\n\nTotal revenue is the money she gets from selling all the lemonade. At $1 per cup, and 36 cups sold, revenue = 36 * $1 = $36.\n\nTotal cost is $18.\n\nSo, profit is $36 - $18 = $18.\n\nThis is the total profit over 9 hours.

So, the key is that her savings need to be sufficient to cover the expenses for 20 years, which is 40% of her current salary. \n\n        So, the amount she needs to save is 40% of her current salary, which is 0.4 * 100,000 = $40,000. Since she is saving 20% of her salary each year, the amount she saves per year is 0.2 * 100,000 = $20,000. Then, the number of years she needs to work to save $40,000 is 40,000 / 20,000 = 2 years.

So, she is giving up 3 sapphires, which are worth 3 * $800 = $2400. \n\n        She receives 2 rubies, each worth $120*hundred, so 2 * $1200 = $2400.\n\n        Therefore, the trade is fair, and she is not gaining or losing money. \n\n        Now, after the trade, Jenna has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. And she has 2 rubies. \n\n        Therefore, the total value is 5 sapphires * $800 + 2 rubies * $1200 = $4000 + $2400 = $6400. \n\n        So, the total value is $6400. \n\n        Answer: 6400\n\n        So", " \n\n        Let's first calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket is $30 and each pair of shoes is $20, so two pairs would be 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $80. \n\n        Next, we calculate how much Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so 4 * $5 = $20. \n\n        Then, we calculate how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn. Let\u2019s denote the number of times she mows the lawn as x. Then, her earnings from mowing the lawn would be x * $4. \n\n        Her total savings after babysitting and mowing the lawn would be her initial savings of $10 plus her earnings from babysitting ($20) plus her earnings from mowing the lawn (4x). So, total savings = $10 + $20 + $4x = $30 + $4x. \n\n        To afford the jacket and shoes, her total savings must be at least $80. So, $30 + $4x \u2265 $80", " Let's go through this step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find out how much profit she makes per hour. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. \n\nWe know that she sells 4 cups per hour, and each cup is sold for $1. So her revenue per hour is 4 cups/hour * $1/cup = $4/hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out her costs. She spent $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups she can make is 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.\n\nShe sells all of the lemonade, so all 36 cups are sold. The total cost is $18, so her cost per cup is $18 / 36 cups = $0.5 per cup.\n\nBut wait, we need to find the cost per hour. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the cost per hour is 4 cups/hour * $0.5/cup = $2 per hour.\n\nSo, her profit per hour is revenue per hour minus cost per hour: $4/hour", " Let's think. \n\nLet me try to figure out how many insects Lily found. So, we know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Also, Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. \n\nLet me start by assigning variables to each person's insects. Let me call the number of insects David found as D. Then, according to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily's insects would be D + 7. \n\nNext, David found half of what Bodhi found. That means Bodhi found twice as many as David. So, Bodhi's insects would be 2D. \n\nNow, the total number of insects is the sum of what each of them found: Lily's + David's + Bodhi's = 43. So, substituting the variables, that's (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43. \n\nLet me combine like terms. D + 7 + D + 2D is 4D + 7. So, 4D + 7 = 43. \n\nTo solve for D, subtract 7 from both sides", " \n\n        Also, please provide the thought process in English as a thinking process, and the final answer in the specified format.\nThought Process:\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step.

The problem also states that 5% of the more dangerous candles have the defect of smelling like wet dog. However, it is not clear whether the 5% is based on the more dangerous candles or the total number of candles. But the problem says \"5% of the more dangerous candles\", which implies that the 5% is of the more dangerous ones, not the total. So we need to find out how many candles are more dangerous. However, the problem does not directly state that. \n\n        Wait, maybe the problem is that the 5% is of all candles, and the 99% is the guarantee that they won't explode. That is, the 5% is part of the 1% that explode? Wait, the problem says \"99% guaranteed not to explode\" so the probability of exploding is 1%.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes is $20, so 2 pairs would be 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is then $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, determine how much Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so that's 4 * $5 = $20.\n\nThen, calculate how much more she needs to cover the total cost of $70. She already has $10 saved, so the amount needed from mowing the lawn is $70 - $10 - $20 = $40.\n\nFinally, determine how many times she must mow the lawn to earn $40. Since she earns $4 each time, that's $40 / $4 = 10 times.\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times.\nAnswer: 10\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and the two pairs of shoes,", " \n\n        To calculate the profit, we need to find the total revenue from selling the lemonade and subtract the cost of the supplies. Then, we need to divide that profit by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand to find the profit per hour.\n\nTo find the total revenue, we first find how many cups of lemonade she has. She makes 3 pitchers, each with 12 cups, so 3*12=36 cups. At $1 per cup, that would be 36*1= $36 in revenue.\n\nTo find the total cost, she spent $18 on supplies. \n\nTherefore, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.\n\nNow, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she is open. She sells 4 cups per hour, so she is open for 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.\n\nThen, $18 profit divided by 9 hours = $2 per hour.\n\nAnswer: 2\nAnswer: 2\n\nThe total profit is $18.

She saves 20% of her salary. Her current salary is $100,000, so she saves 0.20 * 100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much she needs to save for retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 0.40 * 100,000 = $40,000 per year. However, this is the amount she will spend per year in retirement, not the amount she needs to save. \n\nBut the problem doesn\u8282\u8bfe is not directly about the amount she needs to save for retirement, but how many more years she needs to work, given that she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years.

The number who got off was 8, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on. The number of passengers becomes 40 + 40 = 80.\n4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers becomes 80 - 21 = 59.\n5. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. \"3 times fewer\" means the number of passengers getting on is one-third of the number that got off. The number that got off was 21, so 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. The number of passengers becomes 59 + 7 = 66.\n\nTherefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is ", " \n\nTo find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is remaining and then add them up. \n\nFirst, for each glue stick, the amount not used is the original length minus the remaining length. \n\nFor the first glue stick: original length is 12 mm, remaining is 1/6. So, not used is 12 - (1/6 * 12) = 12 - 2 = 10 mm.\n\nFor the second glue stick: remaining is 2/3. So, not used is 12 - (2/3 * 12) = 12 - 8 = 4 mm.\n\nFor the third glue stick: remaining is 1/2. So, not used is 12 - (1/2 * 12) = 12 - 6 = 6 mm.\n\nThen, add the not used lengths: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 mm.\n\nAnswer: 20\nAnswer: 20\n\nThe total length of the glue sticks that are not used is calculated as follows:\n\n- First glue stick:", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. \n\nFirst, let's understand the given information:\n\n- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.\n- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. That means 1% of the candles have a chance of exploding. So, the number of candles that could explode is 1% of 50,000.\n- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. \n\nWait, the problem says \"5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.\" So we need to interpret what \"more dangerous candles\" refer to. \n\nGiven that 99% of candles are guaranteed not to explode, that suggests that 1% of candles are more dangerous (i.e., they have a chance of exploding). Therefore, the number of more dangerous candles is 1% of 50,000, which is 500. \n\nThen, 5% of these more dangerous candles have the wet dog smell.

She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time. 4 times 5 is 20. So she gets $20 from babysitting. Then, she mows the lawn x times, earning $4 each time. So that's 4x. So total money is 10 plus 20 plus 4x. 10 plus 20 is 30, so total money is 30 + 4x.\n\n        She needs this total money to be at least $70. So 30 + 4x \u2265 70.

But the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. \n\n", " \n\n        So, first, let's break down the problem. \n\n        The bird starts at her northern home. \n\n        First leg: 10 hours at 30 mph, so 10*30 = 300 miles south.\n\n        Second leg: 2 hours at 18 mph, so 2*18 = 36 miles north.\n\n        Third leg: 5 hours at 22 mph, so 5*22 = 110 miles south.\n\n        So, total displacement is 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles. \n\n        Therefore, the distance between the two homes is 374 miles.\n\n        Answer: 374\n\nLet me check my steps again. \n\nFirst leg: 10 hours * 30 mph = 300 miles south. \n\nSecond leg: 2 hours * 18 mph = 36 miles north. \n\nThird leg: 5 hours * 22 mph = 110 miles south. \n\nNow, displacement is calculated as the net distance from the starting point. \n\nStarting at home A (north), after first leg", " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - l\u1ecdc\nTo solve this", "\ufffd\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the entire match.\n\n**Step 1: First Half Goals**\n\n- Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.\n- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n\n**Step 2: Second Half Goals**\n\n- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. That is, 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 goals.\n- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half.

So, adding these up:\n\n9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.\n\nThen, he ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. That means he ate 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie. So, we subtract 1 from each of those counts.\n\nOatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8\n\nChocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3\n\nSugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4\n\nSo, after this, he has 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies.\n\nNext, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6.\n\nThen, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nSo, after these steps, he has 6 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 2 sugar cookies. Total is 6 + 3 + 2 = ", " proportions problem. \n\nTo solve the problem, first find out how much soup is available. Let the total amount of soup be 1 unit.\n\nSince the soup can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, this means each adult bowl is 1/4 unit and each child bowl is 1/8 unit.\n\nCalvin, his wife, and their two children total 1 adult + 1 adult + 2 children = 4 people.\n\nEach person will eat one bowl of soup, so the total amount of soup consumed is:\n\nAdults: 2 adults * 1/4 unit per adult = 1/2 unit.\n\nChildren: 2 children * 1/8 unit per child = 1/4 unit.\n\nTotal consumed: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 unit.\n\nTherefore, the leftover soup is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 unit.\n\nNow, we need to find how many times each child can have a bowl of soup. Each child bowl is 1/8 unit. So the number of bowls is (1/4) / (1/8) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nAnswer:", " \n\n        First, calculate the distance the bird travels in each leg of the journey.  Then, calculate the net displacement of the bird.  The displacement is the distance between the two homes.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total displacement of the bird, which represents the distance between her northern and southern homes. The bird's journey involves three legs of travel with different speeds and durations, so we'll calculate the distance for each leg and then determine the net displacement by accounting for the direction of travel.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the distance for each leg of the journey\n\n1. **First leg**: The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 mph.\n   $$\n   \\text{Distance}_1 = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} = 30 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 10 \\, \\text{hours} = 300 \\, \\text{miles}\n   $$\n\n2. **Second leg**: The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 mph.\n   $$\n   \\text{Distance}_2 = 18 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2 \\, \\", " ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ("], [" idiom.\n\nFirst, let's find out the goals scored by each team in the first half. Team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so that's 4 - 2 = 2 goals.\n\nNow, let's look at the second half. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So that's 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\n\nTeam A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So that's 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.\n\nNow, let's add up the goals for each team in both halves. For team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. For team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.\n\nFinally, add the goals for both teams: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = _Blank_. The total number of goals scored in the match is 16.\n\nAnswer: 16\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says Team A scores ", " start with total cookies. Then subtract the ones he ate, subtract the ones he gave away. Then add the ones he baked. Let's see.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Randy has initially.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the cookies he ate (3 total: 1 of each flavor).\n\nStep 3: Subtract the cookies he gave to his friends (2 sugar cookies).\n\nStep 4: Add the cookies he baked (4 of each flavor: 4*3=12 total).\n\nSo let's compute:\n\nInitial total: 9 + 4 + 5 = 18.\n\nSubtract 3 (ate): 18 - 3 = 15.\n\nSubtract 2 (gave away): 15 - 2 = 13.\n\nAdd 12 (baked): 13 + 12 = 25.\n\nSo the answer is 25.\n\nAnswer: 25\n\nWait, but wait.

So 18 -", " proportions. \n\nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the soup. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. \n\nSo, the pot's capacity is equivalent to either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. This means that the pot has enough soup for 4 adults or 8 children. \n\nNow, let's calculate how many bowls of soup are needed for the family. The family consists of Calvin (an adult), his wife (another adult), and their two children. That makes 2 adults and 2 children.\n\nSince Calvin and his wife are adults, they will each need one bowl of soup. That accounts for 2 bowls. The two children will each need one bowl of soup, which accounts for 2 more bowls. So, in total, the family needs 2 + 2 = 4 bowls of soup.\n\nThe pot has enough soup for either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since the family needs 4 bowls in total, we can determine how many child bowls that would be. If 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, then 4 bowls (in any form) would be equivalent to", " \n\n        Also, please note that the problem is not about the distance of the bird's path but about the straight line distance between the two homes.  So the bird's total path is not the same as the straight line distance between the two homes.  So we have to find the straight line distance between the two homes.\n\nTo find the straight line distance between the northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net displacement of the bird.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance the bird travels in each leg of the journey:\n\n1. First leg: 10 hours at 30 mph = 300 miles south.\n2. Second leg: 2 hours at 18 mph = 36 miles north.\n3. Third leg: 5 hours at 22 mph = 110 miles south.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net displacement. The bird first moves 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, which cancels out 36 miles of the 300. Then, she moves 110 miles south again. So net displacement is 300 - 36 - 110 = 154 miles south.\n\nSo", " 58.2649... that is a decimal. So, the answer is 58.2649... but the problem says that the answer must be an integer. So I must have made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\n        So let's see. The problem is about comparing the distances that Blake and Kelly run in 15 minutes. Let's break down each person's distance.\n\n        For Blake: he runs back and forth 15 times. Each time he runs back and forth, he covers the length of the field twice. Since the field is 100 yards long, each one-way trip is 100 yards. So a round trip is 200 yards. So for 15 times, Blake runs 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.\n\n        For Kelly: she runs back and forth once, then decides to run to the 40-yard line and back. So her first run is back and forth on the full field (100 yards). So that's 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 40 yards each way, so", "-team A and team B.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of goals scored by each team in the first half.\nTeam A scores 4 goals in the first half.\nTeam B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so 4 - 2 = 2 goals.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of goals scored by each team in the second half.\nTeam B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half.\nTeam A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, 8 / 4 = 2 goals.\n\nStep 3: Add up the goals for both halves for each team.\nTeam A's total: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.\nTeam B's total: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.\n\nStep 4: Add the totals for both teams.\nTotal goals: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.\n\nThe answer is 16.\n\nAnswer: 16\n", "0\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial total number of cookies.\nRandy has 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies.

The problem states that the pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. This means the total amount of soup is equivalent to either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.\n\nNext, we need to consider how much soup will be consumed by the family. The family consists of Calvin (an adult), his adult wife, and their two children. That's a total of 4 people. Each person eats one bowl of soup, so the total amount of soup needed is 4 bowls.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking about the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup from the leftover soup. This suggests that after everyone has eaten, the leftover soup is to be distributed among the children. So first, we need to figure out how much soup is left after everyone has had their bowl.\n\nThe total amount of soup is equivalent to either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Let's assume that the amount of soup is represented as 4 adult bowls. Then, the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls. But each adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls"], [" \n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled and then determine the net displacement from the northern home to the southern home. \n\nFirst, we calculate the distance for each leg of the journey:\n\n1.

Third leg: The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 mph. The distance is 5 * 22 = 110 miles.\n\nNext, we determine the net displacement. The first leg moves the bird 300 miles south, the second leg moves her 36 miles north (which is a reduction), and the third leg moves her 110 miles south. The net displacement is calculated by subtracting the northward distance from the total southward distance.\n\nNet displacement = (300 + 110) - 36 = 410 - 36 = 37", "://example.com.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Blake runs.

So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance Kelly runs. She runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each round trip is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So, Kelly's total distance is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between Blake's and Kelly's total distances. 3000 - 2720 = 280 yards.\n\nTherefore, Blake ran 280 yards farther than Kelly.\nAnswer: 280\nAnswer: 280\n\nAnswer: 280\n\nAnswer: 280\n\nAnswer: 280\n\n", "\ufffd\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the entire match, which consists of two halves: the first half and the second half.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the first half\n\nIn the **first half**:\n\n- **Team A** scores **4 goals**.\n- **Team B** scores **2 goals fewer than Team A**, so Team B scores **4 - 2 = 2 goals**.\n\nSo, the total number of goals scored in the first half is:\n\n$$\n\\text{First half total} = \\text{Team A goals} + \\text{Team B goals} = 4 + 2 = 6 \\text{ goals}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the second half\n\nIn the **second half**:\n\n- **Team B** scores **4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half**.

The problem states that the pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. This gives us a key proportion to work with.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the capacity of an adult's bowl as A and a child's bowl as C. According to the problem, the total volume of soup is enough to fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. Therefore, we can write:\n\n4A = 8C\n\nThis equation tells us that the total soup is equivalent to either four adult bowls or eight child bowls. From this, we can find the relationship between A and C. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\nA = 2C\n\nSo, an adult bowl is equivalent to two child bowls. This is an important relationship to know.\n\nNow, let's determine how many bowls are needed for the family dinner. Calvin is an adult, and he is eating with his adult wife and their two children. That's a total of four people: two adults and two children.\n\nThe problem asks, \"how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch", " \n\n        First, find the distance the bird flies in each leg of the journey.

The second leg: 18 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 36 miles.  The third leg: 22 mph \u00d7 5 hours = 110 miles.\n\n        Now, to find the net distance, we need to think about the direction of the bird's movement.  The first leg is south, so that adds to the total distance from the home.  The second leg is north, which is opposite to the first leg, so that subtracts from the total.  The third leg is south again, so that adds to the total.\n\n        So, net distance is 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.  Therefore, the distance between the two homes is 374 miles.\n\n        Answer: 374\n        So, the answer is 374.\n\nBut let's", " 15 times. Wait, that's 15 times back and forth.
