So, the number of passengers on the bus after this stop is 48 - 8 = 40.\n\nNext, it says that 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. The number who got off was 8, so 5 times that is 5 * 8 = 40 people getting on. Adding these to the current number of passengers, we have 40 + 40 = 80 passengers on the bus now.\n\nMoving on to the second stop. At this stop, 21 passengers get off. Subtracting these from the current total, we have 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remaining.\n\nThen, it says that 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number that got off. This part is a bit tricky. \"3 times fewer\" can be interpreted as dividing the number that got off by 3.

Then, we subtract that from the original length to find the used length for each. Finally, we add up all the used lengths.\n\nFor the first glue stick, the amount left is 1/6. So, the used length is 12 - (12 * 1/6) = 12 - 2 = 10 mm.\n\nFor the second glue stick, the amount left is 2/3. So, the used length is 12 - (12 * 2/3) = 12 - 8 = 4 mm.\n\nFor the third glue stick, the amount left is 1/2. So, the used length is 12 - (12 * 1/2) = 12 - 6 = 6 mm.\n\nNow, we add up the used lengths: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.\n\nAnswer: 20\n\nAnswer: 20\nAnswer: 20\nAnswer: 20\nAnswer", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, calculate how much Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn. She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so that's 4 \u00d7 $5 = $20. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let x be the number of times she mows the lawn. Then her earnings from mowing the lawn is 4x.\n\nAdding her savings, the total amount of money she has is her savings of $10 plus the money she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn. That gives $10 + $20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.\n\nShe needs to have at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, set up the equation: $30 + 4x \u2265 $70.\n\nSubtract $30 from both", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the profit Millie makes per hour. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. \n\nFirst, let's find out the total number of cups she can make. She has 3 pitchers, each holding 12 cups, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 cups. \n\nNext, we need to find out the total cost. She spent $18 on supplies, which is her total cost.\n\nNow, for the revenue, since she sells each cup for $1 and sells all of the lemonade, the revenue is 36 cups * $1 = $36. \n\nSo, the total profit is revenue minus cost: $36 - $18 = $18.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for profit per hour. She sells 4 cups per hour, so the number of hours she can sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours. \n\nTherefore, the total profit is $18 over 9 hours, so per hour, it's $18 / 9 = $2. \n\nAnswer: 2\n\nAnswer: 2\nAnswer: ", " Do not use any markdown.\n\n        Let's see. The problem says that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects together. Also, Lily found 7 more than David. And David found half of what Bodhi found. So, I need to figure out how many insects Lily found.\n\nFirst, let's assign variables to each person. Let me think. Let me denote the number of insects David found as D. Then, according to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily's number would be D + 7. \n\nThen, David found half of what Bodhi found. So, if David found D, then Bodhi found twice as much as David. That would be 2D. \n\nSo, the total number of insects is Lily's + David's + Bodhi's = (D + 7) + D + 2D. Let me compute that. D + 7 + D + 2D = 4D + 7. \n\nAnd this total is 43. So, 4D + 7 = 43. To find D, subtract 7 from both sides: 4D = 36. Then divide by ", " \n\n        First, calculate the amount Lauren saves per year. Since she saves 20% of her salary, that is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\n        Then, if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, she needs to save $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.\n\n        Then, if she lives on 40% of her current annual salary, that is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.\n\n        So, the amount she needs to save for retirement is $400,000, and she can save $20,000 per year. So, 400,000 / 20,000 = 20 years.\n\n        So, the answer is 20.\n\n        Answer: 20\n   \n\n\n    Answer: 20\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Lauren saving money for retirement.

So, the number of passengers on the bus after this stop is 48 - 8 = 40.\n- 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on. The number who got off was 8, so 5*8 = 40 people get on. Therefore, the number of passengers on the bus now becomes 40 + 40 = 80.\n\nSecond stop:\n- 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers on the bus after this is 80 - 21 = 59.\n- 3 times fewer passengers get on. This means that the number of people getting on is 21 divided by 3, which is 7. Therefore, the number of passengers on the bus is now 59 + 7 = 66.\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 66.\n\nAnswer: 66\nTo solve the problem, we need to track the number of passengers on the bus after", " \n\n        So first, the total length of the three glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters. Then, find the total length of the used parts. The first one has 1/6 left, so 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 used. The second one has 2/3 left, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 used. The third one has 1/2 left, so 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 used. Then, multiply each by 12 to find the used length of each. Then add them all up. \n\n        So first glue stick used: 5/6 * 12 = 10 mm. Second: 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm. Third: 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm. Then, total used is 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 mm. Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm. \n\nAnswer: 20\nTo determine the total length of the glue sticks that are **not used**, we first", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

This means that the percentage of candles that do explode is 100% - 99% = 1%.\n\nNext, we are told that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. However, this is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that 5% of the candles that are dangerous (and might explode) have this defect. But it's possible that the \"more dangerous\" part refers to candles that are more likely to explode, but we need to be careful here.\n\nWait, the problem says: 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. But we are not given the number of more dangerous candles. However, we are told that 1% of the candles explode. It might be that the more dangerous candles are the ones that explode.

The two rubies are worth 2 * 120\u9fcd\n\n        Now, after trading, Jenna has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of these 5 sapphires is 5 * 800 = $4000. The two rubies are worth 2 * 1200 = $2400. So, the total value is $4000 + $2400 = $6400. \n\n        Answer: 6400\n        \"Answer: 6400\" (but the last line is just the answer). The correct answer is 6400.

So, two pairs would be 2 * 20 = $40. Adding the jacket, that's 30 + 40 = $70.\n\n        Then, calculate how much money Sara has from babysitting and mowing the lawn. She babysits 4 times at $5 each, so 4 * 5 = $20. Let's call this amount B. She mows the lawn x times at $4 each, so 4x. She already has $10 saved. So total money is B + 4x + 10.\n\n        The total money must be at least $70. So, 20 + 4x + 10 \u2265 70. Simplify this equation: 4x + 30 \u2265 70. Subtract 30 from both sides: 4x \u2265 40.

She makes 3 pitchers, each with 12 cups. So 3 * 12 = 36 cups total.\n\n        Then, calculate the total revenue. She sells each cup for $1, so 36 cups * $1 = $36 revenue.\n\n        Then, subtract the cost of supplies, which was $18. So $36 - $18 = $18 profit total.\n\n        Now, she sells 4 cups per hour. So, how much profit does she make per hour?\n\n        Let's find out how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, 36 / 4 = 9 hours.\n\n        So, the total profit is $18 over 9 hours.

Let's let D be the number of insects David found. Then, according to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily's insects can be represented as L = D + 7. Also, David found half of what Bodhi found, so B = 2D. The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the equation: L + D + B = 43. Substituting the expressions in terms of D, we get (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43. Combining like terms, we have 4D + 7 = 43. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us 4D = 36. Dividing both sides by 4 gives D = 9. Then, substituting back, Lily found L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.\n\nAnswer: 16\n\nThe answer is 16.

Assuming she gets paid monthly, but the problem doesn't specify the number of paychecks per year, so we'll assume an annual salary. Therefore, 20% of her current annual salary is 0.20 * 100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\n        Next, we need to find out how much she can spend each year, which is 40% of her current annual salary. That would be 0.40 * 100,000 = $40,000 per year.\n\n        The problem says she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. So we need to find out how many more years she needs to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, but the problem seems to be asking how many more years she needs to work to reach a certain goal.

So, the number of people on the bus becomes 40 + 40 = 80.\n\nSecond stop: 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes 80 - 21 = 59.\n\nThen, 3 times fewer passengers get on. The term \"3 times fewer\" is a bit ambiguous, but usually, it means the number of people getting on is one-third of the previous number. However, in some contexts, it might mean the number is reduced by three times, i.e., divided by four. But in most mathematical contexts, \"3 times fewer\" is interpreted as dividing by 4. However, to be precise, \"3 times fewer\" is a bit of", " Let me know if you need to clarify the question.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used. Each glue stick is originally 12 millimeters long. The amounts of glue left in each of the three glue sticks are given as 1/6, 2/3, and 1/2, respectively. Therefore, the length of the unused part of each glue stick is the original length minus the length that is left.\n\nFor the first glue stick, the unused length is 12 - (1/6 of 12). Calculating that: 12 \u00d7 (1/6) = 2. So, the unused length is 12 - 2 = 10 millimeters.\n\nFor the second glue stick, the unused length is 12 - (2/3 of 12). Calculating that: 12 \u00d7 (2/3) = 8.

If she makes 50,000 candles, the number of candles that explode is 1% of 50,000. Let's calculate that:\n\n1% of 50,000 = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500.\n\nSo, 500 candles are expected to explode.\n\nNow, we are told that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This seems to be a bit ambiguous, but I will make a logical assumption here. It is possible that the \"more dangerous candles\" refer to the ones that are more likely to explode or have other issues.

Each ruby is worth $120 Cosmetic, so two rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400. \n\n        So, the total value is the value of the sapphires left plus the value of the rubies.

Adding the jacket, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Sara makes from babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she does it 4 times. So, 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting.\n\nThen, we look at the money she gets from mowing the lawn. Her parents pay her $4 each time she does it. Let\u2019s call the number of times she mows the lawn \"x.\" Therefore, the money from mowing is 4x.\n\nShe already has $10 saved.

She spent $18 to make all the lemonade, so her total cost is $18.\n\nThen, we need to calculate her total revenue. She sells each cup for $1 and she sells all 36 cups, so her total revenue is 36 \u00d7 $1 = $36.\n\nProfit is total revenue minus total cost. So, $36 - $18 = $18 total profit for the entire lemonade stand.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much profit she makes per hour. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. So, per hour, she sells 4 cups, which makes $4 in revenue per hour.\n\nBut wait, we need to find the profit, not just the revenue. So, per hour, her cost is the cost of the lemonade she sells.

Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn. She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so that's 4 * $5 = $20.

She sells 4 cups per hour. Each cup is sold at $1, so revenue per hour is 4 * $1 = $4.\n\nBut we need to consider the cost per hour.

The number who got off was 8, so 5*8 = 40 people get on.\n4. So, after the first stop, the number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.\n5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remain.\n6. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. The wording here is a bit tricky. \"3 times fewer\" usually means dividing by 3.

So the problem is asking for the total length of the glue sticks that are not used. \n\n        First, I need to figure out how much of each glue stick is not used. Wait, but the problem says \"the total length of the glue sticks that are not used.\" So for each glue stick, the remaining part is not used. So the total not used would be the sum of the remaining parts of each glue stick.\n\n        So, for the first glue stick: 1/6 left. Original length is 12 mm. So the remaining is 12 * (1/6) = 2 mm. \n\n        Second glue stick: 2/3 left. So 12 * (2/3) = 8 mm.\n\n        Third glue stick: 1/2 left. 12 * (1/2) = 6 mm.\n\n        Then add them up: 2", " \n\n        Let's break it down. \n\n        First, let's figure out how many candles will explode.

The problem says that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have the defect. But we don't know what \"more dangerous candles\" means here. However, since the problem is asking for the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog, we can assume that the 5% is referring to the total candles, not just the more dangerous ones. \n\n        So, 5% of 50000 is 0.05 \u00d7 50000 = 2500 candles. \n\n        However, we need to find the overlap between the two groups: those that explode and those that smell like wet dog.

So, in total, she has 5 sapphires and 2 rubies.\n\n        Now, we need to calculate the total value of her jewels.\n\n        Sapphires are worth $800 each, so 5 sapphires are worth 5 * 800 = $4000.\n\n        Rubies are worth $120\u4ea6 each, so 2 rubies are worth 2 * 1200 = $2400.\n\n        Adding these together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.\n\n        Therefore, all her jewels are worth $6400.\n\n        Answer", " The answer must be in the box. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, given her initial savings and earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, that\u2019s 2 * $20 = $40. Adding the jacket, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, we calculate how much Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so 4 * $5 = $20.\n\nSara also has $10 already saved, so her total money before mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 = $30.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more she needs to afford the $70 jacket and shoes.

So if I let David's number be D, then Lily's number is D + 7.\n\n        Then, David found half of what Bodhi found. So, if David is D, then Bodhi's number is 2D.\n\n        So, the total is Lily + David + Bodhi = (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43.\n\n        Combining terms: D +7 + D + 2D = 4D +7 = 43.\n\n        So, 4D +7 = 43.

The pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. So, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. This means that 1 adult bowl equals 2 child bowls in terms of volume (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, so 1 adult = 2 children).\n\nStep 3: Calculate how much soup is used by the family.

Calvin is an adult, his wife is an adult, and they have two children. That's a total of 4 people.\n\nNow, we know that the pot has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. This means that the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. So, we can think of this as a proportion problem where we need to find out how much of the pot is used for the family meal.\n\nSince there are 4 people in total and 4 adult bowls, the total amount of soup used for the meal is 4 adult bowls. Alternatively, since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls, 4 adult bowls would be equivalent to 8 child bowls. Therefore, the amount of soup used for the meal is 8 child bowls.\n\nThe pot initially has enough soup for 8 child bowls.

The bird first flies 10 hours at 30 mph in a southerly direction, so that's 10*30=300 miles.  Then she flies 2 hours at 18 mph towards the north, so that's 2*18=36 miles.  Then she flies 5 hours at 22 mph towards the south, so that's 5*22=110 miles.  To find the total distance between the two homes, we need to add the first leg of the journey and the third leg, and then subtract the second leg, because the second leg is in the opposite direction.  So that's 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles.

Therefore, for each back and forth trip, Blake runs 100 yards * 2 = 200 yards. So, for 15 trips, Blake's total distance is 200 yards * 15 = 3000 yards.\n\n        Next, let's calculate how much Kelly ran. She initially runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards as well. Then, she changes her strategy and runs to the 40-yard line and back. That trip is from the starting line to the 40-yard line and back, which is 40 * 2 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times.

Let's define the amount of soup for an adult bowl as A and for a child bowl as C. Therefore, we have:\n\n4A = 8C\n\nThis equation tells us that the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. So, we can say that 4A = 8C. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get:\n\nA = 2C\n\nThis tells us that an adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls in terms of soup volume. So, each adult bowl is twice as much as a child bowl.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of soup in terms of child bowls.

Kelly initially runs back and forth once, covering a distance of 2 times 100 yards, which is 200 yards. Then, she changes her strategy and runs to the 40-yard line and back. Each time she does this, she runs a distance of 2 times 40 yards, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance for this part is 34 times 80 yards, which is 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, her total distance is 200 + 272", "ing\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, in the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.\n\nNext, in the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, it scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\n\nThen, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, so team A scores 8 / 4 = 2 goals in the second half.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:\n\nFirst half: team A scores 4, team B scores 2.\n\nSecond half: team A scores 2, team B scores 8.\n\nTotal goals = 4 + 2 + 2 + 8 = 16.\n\nSo, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16.\nAnswer: 16\n\nBut wait,", " start with total number of cookies, then subtract the ones he ate and gave away, then add the ones he baked.

Wait, 9+4 is 13, plus 5 is 18. Yes. Then he ate 3 cookies for a snack, one of each flavor. So that's 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, 1 sugar cookie. So he ate 3 cookies, which reduces the total by 3. Then he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So that's 2 more, total eaten now is 5. Then he gives 2 sugar cookies to friends, so that's 2 less. Then he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So that's 4 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, 4 sugar. \n\nSo initial total is 9+4+5=18.

He has a pot that can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. He is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. So that's 1 adult (Calvin) + 1 adult wife + 2 children = 4 people total. Everyone eats one bowl at a meal. The question is asking, how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?\n\nWait, the problem says \"how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?\" Hmm, maybe I need to think about the total amount of soup and how much each bowl takes.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. The pot has enough soup to fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. So that means the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. So, the volume of soup is the same in both cases. Let's think in terms of proportions. If an adult bowl is 1 unit, then the total soup is 4 units.", " \n\n        So, the problem is asking for the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.  The bird's journey involves three legs of flight.  First, she flies south for 10 hours at 30 mph.  Then, she flies north for 2 hours at 18 mph.  Finally, she flies south for 5 hours at 22 mph.  To find the total distance between the two homes, we need to calculate the net displacement of the bird from her starting point to her final destination.  This is done by calculating the distance flown in each direction and then subtracting the distances in opposite directions.\n\nFirst leg: south for 10 hours at 30 mph.  Distance = speed \u00d7 time = 30 \u00d7 10 = 300 miles south.\n\nSecond leg: north for 2 hours at 18 mph.  Distance = 18 \u00d7 2 = 36 miles north.\n\nThird leg: south for 5 hours at 22 mph.

He runs back and forth 15 times. Each time he runs back and forth, he covers the entire length of the football field twice (there and back). The football field is 100 yards long, so each back and forth is 100 * 2 = 200 yards. So, Blake runs 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.\n\nNext, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. She initially runs back and forth once, which is 100 * 2 = 200 yards. Then she changes her route and runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 40 * 2 = 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times. So, 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the first run, Kelly runs 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.\n\nNow, to find the difference between the winner and the loser: Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions the first half of the match. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Then, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. So, if team A scored 4, then team B scored 4 minus 2, which is 2 goals in the first half. Let me note that down:\n\nFirst half:\n- Team A: 4 goals\n- Team B: 4 - 2 = 2 goals\n\nNow, moving on to the second half. The problem says that in the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. But also, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Let me parse that.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many goals team B scored in the second half. The problem says team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. In the first half, team B scored 2 goals. So,", " start with total cookies. Then, subtract the ones he ate, subtract the ones he gave away. Then add the ones he baked.

That means 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, 1 sugar. So he ate 3 cookies.\n\nSo, subtract 3 from total: 18 - 3 = 15.\n\nThen, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So subtract 2 oatmeal: 15 - 2 = 13.\n\nThen, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So subtract 2 sugar: 13 - 2 = 11.\n\nThen, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So he bakes 4 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, 4 sugar. That's 4*3=12 cookies added.\n\nSo add", " proportions.\n\nTo solve this problem, let's start by understanding the total number of bowls that the pot can hold. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. This implies that the total amount of soup is equivalent to either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. \n\nNext, we need to determine how many bowls each person will eat. Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. That's a total of 1 adult + 1 adult + 2 children = 4 people. \n\nNow, we need to calculate how many bowls of soup are needed for the four people. The problem states that each person eats one bowl at a meal, so the total number of bowls needed is 4.\n\nWe can now calculate how many times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup from the leftover soup. First, we need to find out how much soup is left after everyone has had their bowl.

Then, she flies south for 5 hours at 22 mph, which is 110 miles.  The total distance she flew is 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles. But that's the total distance, not the distance between the two homes.  So, we need to find the net displacement.\n\n        The first leg is 300 miles south. Then, the second leg is 36 miles north, so the net displacement after two legs is 300 - 36 = 264 miles south. Then, the third leg is 110 miles south, so the net displacement is 264 + 110 = 374 miles.
