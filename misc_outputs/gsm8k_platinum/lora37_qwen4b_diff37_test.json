For the second option, eating donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. The difference in weight change per week would be the difference between losing 1.25 and gaining 1.75. That is, 1.75 minus 1.25, which equals 0.5 pounds per week. \n\n        Then, over 5 weeks, that difference would be 0.5 pounds/week multiplied by 5 weeks, which is 2.5 pounds. \n\n        Wait, but let me check that again. If he loses 1.25 and gains 1.75, the difference in weight between the two options is 1.75 - 1.25 = 0.5 pounds per week. So over 5 weeks, 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 pounds.

There are 10 students, and only 8 can try the escape room at a time. We need to find out how many groups of 8 students are needed to accommodate all 10 students.\n\nThe number of groups required is calculated by dividing the total number of students by the number of students that can try at a time. Since 10 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 2, we need 2 groups. However, because we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up. So, 10 students would require 2 groups (1 group of 8 students and 1 group of 2 students).\n\nEach group takes 45 minutes, so the total time for 2 groups is 2 * 45 minutes = 90 minutes.\n\nBut, the problem states that there are multiple", " \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many crates Sam sold during the week and compare that to his target of 120 crates. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of crates sold. \n\nHe sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is Saturday and Sunday.

Petunias cost $3.00 each, so 15 petunias cost 15 * $3.00 = $45.00. Sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, so 10 vines cost 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.\n\nFinally, we add the two costs together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 in total.\n\nAnswer: 70\nAnswer: 70\n\nStep-by", " Do not include any intermediate steps.\n\n        Let's see.

Let's break that down. The \"amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys\" would be 600 shells. Then, \"four times as many seashells as the boys\" is 4 * 600 = tract.

I need to find out how many are chickens. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. So, if I let the number of chickens be C and the number of cows be W (for cows), then the total number of animals is C + W = 20. That's one equation.\n\nThen for the legs: chickens contribute 2C legs and cows contribute 4W legs. The total legs are 70, so 2C + 4W = 70.

Therefore, Wendy's current age is five times that: W = 5*(C + 7).\n\nThen, the problem states that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. In 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. Wendy's current age is W. So, according to this, C + 25 = (1/3)*W.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. W = 5*(C + 7)\n2.

Let x be the number of chickens and y be the number of cows. We know that x + y = 20, since there are 20 animals in total. We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, the equation for the legs would be 2x + 4y = 70. \n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. Let's use the substitution method. From the first equation, we can express y as 20 - x. Substituting this into the second equation gives us 2x + 4(20 - x) = 70. \n\nSimplifying the equation: 2x + 80 - 4x = 70. Combining like terms: -2x + 80 = 70. Subtracting 80 from both sides gives us -2x = -10.

Since she taught 2 classes, which is less than 3, she does not get the additional $5.\n\nEarnings for Wednesday = (15 * 2) = $30.\n\nTotal earnings for both days = 80 + 30 = $110.\n\nAnswer: 110\nAnswer: 110\n\nThe problem requires calculating Tanya\u2019s earnings for two days, Monday and Wednesday, based on her hourly rate and a daily bonus for teaching more than 3 classes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate earnings for Monday**\n- Tanya teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she qualifies for the bonus.\n- She teaches for 5 hours. \n- Her", " \n\n        Let me think. \n\n        So, the problem says there are twenty kids on a school trip. They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, first, I need to figure out how many girls and how many boys there are. Since there are 20 kids total, and they are split into two equal groups, that would mean 10 girls and 10 boys. \n\n        Now, the boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. So each boy brought 60 shells. \n\n        Then, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Wait, let me parse that sentence again. \n\n        \"The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\" Hmm, the wording here is a bit confusing. \n\n        Let me rephrase it. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (so, 60 shells) plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Wait, does that mean four times as many as the boys brought?"]], "accuracies": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.125, 0.125, 0.125, 0.125, 0.125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}
