That would be 1.75 pounds (gain from donuts) minus 1.25 pounds (loss from Cheerios). \n\n        So, 1.75 - 1.25 = 0.5 pounds per week difference.\n\n        Then, multiply that weekly difference by the number of weeks, which is 5.\n\n        0.5 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 2.5 pounds.\n\n        Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks would be 2.5 pounds. Since the problem asks for an integer, we need to round this to the nearest whole number, which is 2 or 3. However, since 0.5 is exactly halfway, the standard rounding rule would round up, so the answer is 3. But wait, the problem says \"difference in his weight\" and doesn\u3051\u308ct specify whether it's a positive or negative number.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, each group will consist of 8 students. The number of groups needed for 10 students is calculated by dividing the total number of students by the number of students that can try at a time. So, 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to 2 groups for each grade. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the total time required for each grade. If each group takes 45 minutes, then 2 groups will take 2 times 45 minutes, which is 90 minutes. \n\nHowever, since the problem is about all students in grades 4 through 7, we need to consider that there are 4 grades.

Since each cell phone costs $150 and she bought five of them, the total cost is 5 times 150.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest is 2% of the total cost, so multiply the total cost by 0.02.\n\nStep 3: Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.\n\nStep 4: Divide the total amount to be paid by 3 to find the monthly installment.\n\nLet's go through each step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the five cell phones. Each phone is $150, so 5 times 150 equals 750. So the total cost before interest is $750.\n\nNext, we calculate the interest. 2% of 750 is 0.02 times 750, which equals 15. So the interest is $15.\n\nNow, we add the interest to the total cost. 750 plus 15 is 765.", " Do not use markdown.\n\n        Let's break this down step by step. First, we know that Katarina has 68 cookies. The problem states that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if we let M represent the number of cookies Max has, then Katarina's cookies are M - 5. Since Katarina has 68, we can set up the equation: M - 5 = 68. Solving for M, we add 5 to both sides, giving us M = 73. So Max has 73 cookies.\n\n        Next, we are told that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Let's let C represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Then, Max's cookies are C + 12. Since we know Max has 73, we can set up the equation: C + 12 = 73. Solving for C, we subtract 12 from both sides, getting C = 61. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.\n\n        Then, the problem states that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.

Since there are 10 students and only 8 can try at a time, we divide 10 by 8. This gives 1.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2 groups. This means that for each grade, we need 2 groups of 8 students to ensure all 10 students get to try the escape room.\n\nNext, we calculate the total time required. Each group takes 45 minutes, and there are 2 groups per grade. Therefore, the total time for each grade is 2 * 45 minutes = 90 minutes.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify that the escape rooms are set up for multiple grades at the same time, we assume that the time is calculated per grade.

The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. The boys each brought back 60 shells, so the number of shells each girl brought is 60 (the same as the boys) plus 4 times 60.

Since each story is 24 feet high, the starting height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.\n\n2. **First Bounce:**\n   After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of its previous height. So, the height after the first bounce is 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet.\n\n3. **Second Bounce:**\n   On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce. Thus, the height on the second bounce is 48 * (2/3) = 32 feet.\n\nTherefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.\n\nAnswer: 32\nAnswer: 32\n\nStep-by-step Explanation:\n\n1. Starting height: 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.\n2. First bounce: 72 *", "'t' (do not use the quotes). \n\nTo solve this problem, first calculate the total number of people Martha invited.

Adding those together, 12 + 12 = 24 people in total.\n\nNext, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. The problem states that 8 people couldn't come. Then, it says that 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. Let's calculate 1/4 of 8, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.\n\nSo, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 (illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.\n\nSubtracting that from the total number of people invited, 24 - 10 = 14 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.\n\nAnswer: 14\n\nWait, let me check my steps again", " step-by-step, then put the answer in the format specified.\n\nAnswer: 15\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- Let C be the number of chickens.\n- Let K be the number of cows.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. The total number of animals is 20: C + K = 20.\n2. The total number of legs is 70: Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so 2C + 4K = 70.\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing by 2: C + 2K = 35.\n\nNow, we have the system of equations:\n- C + K = 20\n- C + 2K = 35\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives: (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \u2192 K = 15.\n\nSo, there are 15 cows. Since the total number of animals is 20, there are 20 - 15 = 5", "-step, then the final answer.\n\nStep 1: Let\u2019s define the variables. Let C be Colin\u2019s current age and W be Wendy\u2019s current age.\n\nStep 2: Translate the first sentence into an equation. \"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.\" This means that Wendy's current age is five times Colin's age in seven years. So, W = 5*(C + 7).\n\nStep 3: Translate the second sentence into an equation. \"In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.\" This means that in 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's current age. So, C + 25 = (1/3)*W.\n\nStep 4: Now we have two equations:\n\n1. W = 5*(C + 7)\n2. C + 25 = (1/3)*W\n\nStep 5: Substitute equation 1 into equation 2.

The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (the number of shells brought by the boys) plus 4 times 60 (which is 240). Adding these together gives 60 + 240 = 300 shells. \n\nSince there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells by the number of girls to find out how many shells each girl brought. So, 300 divided by 10 is 30. Therefore, each girl brought 30 seashells. \n\nThe answer is 30.\n\nAnswer: 30\n\nWait, let me recheck.

So, the total number of animals is C + C = 20. Then we have 2C + 2C = 70. But this is wrong. So, we need to adjust that. \n\n        Step 2: Wait, chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, we need to set up equations. Let\u2019s denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. Then, we have C + W = 20. Also, 2C + 4W = 70. \n\n        Step 3: Now, we can solve these equations. From the first equation, C = 20 - W. Substitute that into the second equation: 2(20 - W) + 4W = 70.

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, the number of people who actually came is 24 (total invited) - 8 (couldn't come) = 16 people.\n\n3. Additionally, we are told that 1/4 of that number (the 8 people who couldn't come) had previous commitments. Let's verify this: 1/4 of 8 is 2 people.

So, the girls brought 60 (boys' shells) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 shells each.\n\nTherefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.\n\nAnswer: 300\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the number of girls and boys\nThere are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into **two equal groups** \u2014 one group of girls and one group of boys", "'s.\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to find out the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since Nathan is dropping the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.\n\n2. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its previous height with each bounce. So, the first bounce reaches (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.\n\n3. The second bounce is 2/3rds of the height of the first bounce, so (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.\n\nTherefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.\n\nAnswer: 32\nAnswer: 32", "'t' and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\" and \"\u2019\"", " step-by-step, then put the final answer in the format \"Answer: XXX\".\n\n        Step 1: Let the number of chickens be C and the number of cows be W.\n        Step 2: Since there are 20 animals total, C + W = 20.\n        Step 3: Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, the total legs are 2C + 4W = 70.\n        Step 4: Now solve these two equations. From equation 2, we can express C = 20 - W.\n        Step 5: Substitute this into equation 3: 2(20 - W) + 4W = 70. Simplify: 40 - 2W + 4W = 70. Combine like terms: 40 + 2W = 70.\n        Step 6: Subtract 40 from both sides: 2W = 30. Divide by 2: W = 15.\n        Step 7: Substitute W = 15 into equation 2: C + 15 = 20.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.\n\nThe first statement is: Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.\n\nSo, seven years from now, Colin will be C + 7 years old. Therefore, Wendy's current age is five times that, which gives us:\n\nW = 5 * (C + 7)  --> Equation 1\n\nThe second statement is: In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.\n\nIn 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. Wendy's current age is W. So the second equation is:\n\nC + 25 = (1/3) * W  --> Equation 2\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) W = 5*(C + 7)\n2) C + 25 = (1/3) * W\n\nWe can", " calculate the total earnings for each day and sum them up.\n\nOn Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. The hourly rate is $15, so the base pay is 5 hours * $15 = $75. Then, since she teaches more than 3 classes (4 classes), she gets an additional $5. So Monday's earnings are $75 + $5 = $80.\n\nOn Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. The base pay is 2 hours * $15 = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she doesn't get the additional $5. So Wednesday's earnings are $30.\n\nTotal earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.\n\nAnswer: 110\nAnswer: 110\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday separately and then sum them up.\n\n**Monday's Earnings:**\n\n- **Hours taught:** 5 hours  \n  - **Hourly rate:** $15/hour  \n  - **Base pay:** 5 *", " Make sure the number is correct.\n\nTo solve this problem, we first need to determine how many boys and girls there are. Since there are twenty kids total and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, that means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\nNext, we know that the boys each brought back 60 shells. Now, the problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. \n\nLet's break down the number of shells brought by the girls. The number of shells brought by the girls is equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (60) plus four times that number (4*60). So, that's 60 + (4*60) = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.\n\nBut wait, this is the total number of shells brought by all the girls. Since there are 10 girls, to find out how many shells each girl brought, we divide the total by the number of girls. So, 300 divided by 10 is 30.\n\nTherefore, each girl brought "]], "accuracies": [0.125, 0.0, 0.125, 0.125, 0.0, 0.125, 0.125, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.125]}
