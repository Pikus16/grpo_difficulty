So the total number of people consumed is the sum of the people on each ship:\n\nx (first hundred years) + 2x (second hundred years) + 4x (third hundred years) = 847\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7x = 847\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nx = 847 / 7\n\nx = 121\n\nSo the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is 121.\n\nAnswer: 121", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to think step-by-step.\n\nLet's start by assuming that the number of people on the first ship is 'x'. Since each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, the number of people on the second ship will be 2x, and the number of people on the third ship will be 2(2x) = 4x.\n\nWe are given that the monster has consumed 847 people over three hundred years. So, the sum of the number of people on the three ships should be equal to 847:\n\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7x = 847\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\nx = 847 / 7\nx = 121\n\nSo, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is 121.\n\nAnswer: 121", "\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The monster consumes 847 people over 300 years.\n2. It eats a ship every hundred years, so there are 3 ships in total.\n3. Each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, which means the number of people on the ships follow a geometric progression: x, 2x, 4x, where x is the number of people on the first ship.\n4. Since the monster consumes 847 people over 300 years, the sum of the number of people on all three ships must be 847. We can write an equation based on this:\n   x + 2x + 4x = 847\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   7x = 847\n6. Solving for x, we get:\n   x = 847 / 7\n   x = 121\n\nSo, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nAnswer: 121", "\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\n1.

Since each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, the number of people on the second ship is 2x, and the number of people on the third ship is 2 * 2x = 4x.\n3. Over the three hundred years, the total number of people consumed is the sum of the number of people on the three ships, which is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.\n4. We are told that the total number of people consumed is 847, so 7x = 847.\n5. To solve for x, divide both sides by 7: x = 847 / 7.\n6.

The remaining weight to be gained after eating berries is 1000 - 200 = 800 pounds.\n4. During autumn, it gained twice the amount from acorns as it did from berries. Twice the amount from berries is 200 * 2 = 400 pounds. This means the bear gained 400 pounds from acorns.\n5. The remaining weight to be gained after eating acorns is 800 - 400 = 400 pounds.\n6. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight. Half of 400 pounds is 400 * 1/2 = 200 pounds.\n7. The weight gained from eating salmon is 200 pounds.\n8.

We can do this by subtracting the time taken by the hare from the time taken by the turtle:\n\nHead start needed = Time taken by turtle - Time taken by hare =", "\n\nStep 1:  First, we need to determine how long it takes for the hare to finish the race. The hare runs at a speed of 10 feet/second, and the race is 20 feet long. \n\nTo find the time it takes for the hare to finish the race, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nStep 2:  For the hare, the distance is 20 feet, and the speed is 10 feet/second. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: time = 20 / 10 = 2 seconds.\n\nStep 3:  Now, we need to determine how long it takes for the turtle to finish the race. The turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot/second, and the race is 20 feet long.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the turtle to finish the race, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nStep 4:  For the turtle, the distance is 20 feet, and the speed is 1 foot/second.

Since the turtle crawls at 1 foot/second, it will finish the 20-foot race in 20/1 = 20 seconds.\n\nStep 3:  To determine the head start the turtle needs to finish in a tie, we need to find the difference in time between the hare and the turtle. This can be calculated as 20 - 2 = 18 seconds.\n\nStep 4:  Therefore, the turtle needs an 18-second head start to finish in a tie with the hare.\n\nAnswer: 18", "\n\nTo find out how much of a head start the turtle needs, we need to find out how long it will take for the hare to finish the race.

Since last year, one year has passed, Dallas's age now = last year Dallas's age + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nAnswer: 49", "\n\nStep 1: First, we need to find Darcy's age. We know Dexter is 8 years old and Darcy is twice as old as Dexter. So, Darcy's age is 2 * 8 = 16.\n\nStep 2: Since Darcy is 16 years old, and Dallas was 3 times the age of Darcy last year, we need to calculate Darcy's age last year. Darcy's age last year was 16 - 1 = 15.\n\nStep 3: Now, we know Dallas was 3 times the age of Darcy last year. So, Dallas's age last year was 3 * 15 = 45.\n\nStep 4: Since Dallas was 45 last year, we need to add 1 year to find his age now.

The third child was born on the fourth birthday of the second child. Since the second child was born 14 years ago, the third child was born 14 years ago - 4 years = 10 years ago.\n4.  The fourth child was born two years after the birth of the third child. Since the third child was born 10 years ago, the fourth child was born 10 years ago - 2 years = 8 years ago.\n5.

Jolene and Phil gave birth to their first child exactly 15 years ago. This means the first child is 15 years old.\n\n2. They gave birth to their second child exactly one year after the birth of their first child. Since the first child is 15 years old, the second child is 15 + 1 = 16 years old.\n\n3. They gave birth to their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child. This means the second child is 4 years old. Since the second child is 4 years old and the first child is 15 years old, the third child is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n\n4. Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child. This means the third child is 2 years old when the fourth child is born. Since the third child is 19 years old, we can set up an equation to find the age of the third child when the fourth child is born: 19 = 2 + age of fourth child when born. Solving for the age of the fourth child when born, we get: age"], ["\n\nTo find the total number of push-ups Bryan did, we need to first calculate the number of push-ups he would have done if he completed all 3 sets.\n\nSince he decided to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each, the total number of push-ups would be: \n3 sets * 15 push-ups/set = 45 push-ups\n\nHowever, Bryan got tired near the end of the third set and did 5 fewer push-ups.

The number of desktop computers sold is 0.17 * 72 = 12.24.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a computer, we round down to the nearest whole number.\nThe number of desktop computers sold is 12.\n\nAnswer: 12", "\n\nStep 1:  Determine the fraction of laptops and netbooks sold. Half of the sales are laptops, so laptops constitute 1/2 or 50% of the sales. One-third of the sales are netbooks, so netbooks constitute 1/3 or approximately 33.33% of the sales.\n\nStep 2:  Calculate the combined percentage of laptops and netbooks. To do this, we need to add the fractions of laptops and netbooks. Since 50% is the same as 1/2 and 33.33% is the same as 1/3, we first convert 50% to a fraction with a common denominator, which is 6 in this case: 1/2 = 3/6, so 50% = 3/6. Now we can add the fractions: 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. This means that laptops and netbooks combined make up 5/6 of the sales.\n\nStep 3:  Determine the fraction of desktop computers. Since the rest of the computers are desktops, and laptops and netbooks make up 5/6 of the sales, the fraction of desktops can be", "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to first find the total number of laptops and netbooks sold.\n\nSince half of the sales are laptops, the number of laptops sold is half of 72, which is 36.\n\nSince one-third of the sales are netbooks, the number of netbooks sold is one-third of 72, which is 24.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of desktop computers sold. Let's call the number of desktop computers sold x.\n\nSince the rest of the computers sold are desktop computers, the total number of computers sold is the sum of laptops, netbooks, and desktop computers.\n\n36 (laptops) + 24 (netbooks) + x (desktop computers) = 72\n\nTo find x, we can subtract 36 + 24 from both sides of the equation:\n\n36 + 24 + x = 72\n\n60 + x = 72\n\nNow, subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 72 - 60\n\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, the number of desktop computers sold is 12.\n\nAnswer: 12"], ["\n\nTo find the total number of cookies Ann keeps, we need to first calculate the total number of cookies she baked, and then subtract the number of cookies she gave away.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cookies she baked:\n- Three dozen oatmeal raisin cookies = 3 * 12 = 36 cookies\n- Two dozen sugar cookies = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies\n- Four dozen chocolate chip cookies = 4 * 12 = 48 cookies\nTotal cookies baked = 36 + 24 + 48 = 108 cookies\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cookies she gave away:\n- Two dozen oatmeal raisin cookies = 2 * 12 = 24 cookies\n- 1.5 dozen sugar cookies = 1.5 * 12 = 18 cookies\n- 2.5 dozen chocolate chip cookies = 2.5 * 12 = 30 cookies\nTotal cookies given away = 24 + 18 + 30 = 72 cookies\n\nFinally, let's subtract the total number of cookies given away from the total number of cookies baked to find the number of cookies Ann keeps:\nTotal cookies kept = Total cookies baked - Total cookies", "\n\nStep 1: First, let's determine how many cookies Ann bakes.

Next, add the tax to the total cost to find the total amount Austin paid:\n   Total amount paid = Total cost + Tax\n   Total amount paid = $61.25 + $7.22 = $68.47\n\n3. Now, we know that Austin received $11.53 in change. Let's call the initial amount Austin had 'x'.\n   We can write the equation: x - $68.47 = $11.53\n   To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.\n\n4. To do that, add $68.47 to both sides of the equation:\n   x = $11.53 + $68.47\n   x = $80.00\n\nSo, Austin started with $80.00. \n\nAnswer: 80", "\n\nTo find the initial amount of money Austin had, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street. This means he has 40% left.\n2. Of the remaining ones, he loses half down a sewer. This means he has half of 40%, which is 20% of the original amount left.\n3. He has 20 marbles left.\n\nLet x be the original number of marbles Archie had. Then:\n\n1. 60% of x is lost into the street, leaving 40% of x.\n2. Half of 40% is 20%. So, 20% of x is left after losing half of the remaining marbles.\n\nNow, let's set up the equation:\n\n20% of x = 20\n\nTo find x, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal and divide:\n\n0.20x = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 0.20:\n\nx = 20 / 0.20\nx = 100\n\nSo, Archie started with 100 marbles.\n\nAnswer: 100", "\n\nStep 1: Let's assume Archie initially had a certain number of marbles, which we'll call 'x'.\n\nStep 2: He loses 60% of his marbles into the street. This means he loses 0.6x marbles. \n\nStep 3: After losing 60%, he is left with 40% of his initial marbles, which is 0.4x.\n\nStep 4: Now, he loses half of the remaining marbles down the sewer. Half of 0.4x is 0.2x.\n\nStep 5: After losing half down the sewer, he has 0.2x marbles left.\n\nStep 6: We are told that Archie has 20 marbles left. So, we can set up the equation 0.2x = 20.\n\nStep 7: To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.2: x = 20 / 0.2\n\nStep 8: Calculating x, we get x = 100.\n\nAnswer: 100", "\n\nLet's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1. Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street. This means he has 40% left (100% - 60% = 40%).\n\n2. If he has 40% left after losing 60%, it means he still has 40% of the original amount of marbles. \n\n3. Then, he loses half of the remaining marbles down a sewer. If we assume the remaining marbles are 100%, losing half means he is left with 50% of that 40% (0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2 or 20%). \n\n4. This 20% is 0.2 times the original amount. If 20 is 0.2 times the original amount, we can find the original amount by dividing 20 by 0.2.\n\n5. To divide 20 by 0.2, we multiply 20 by 5 (the inverse of 0.2). This gives us 100.\n\nSo, Archie started with 100 marbles.\n\nAnswer: 100", "\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street.

Since the Skipper covered 600 kilometers in the first 20 hours, the distance covered after the storm is 400 kilometers, we can calculate the distance covered during the storm.\n\nDistance covered during the storm = distance covered after the storm - distance covered in the first ", "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. The Skipper traveled due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. \n   First, we need to find the distance he covered in 20 hours. We can do this by multiplying the speed by the time:\n   distance = speed * time = 30 km/h * 20 h = 600 km.\n   Since he traveled due east, this distance is the distance covered towards the destination.\n\n2. He then traveled one-third of the way to the destination. Since the total distance to the destination is 600 km, the one-third of the way distance is:\n   one-third distance = total distance / 3 = 600 km / 3 = 200 km.\n\n3. Since he was at the one-third mark after traveling 600 km east, we need to figure out how far he must be from the starting point after the storm. Since the total distance is 600 km and he is one-third of the way to the destination, he has 200 km left to travel to reach the destination. This means he was 600 km - 200 km = 400 km from the starting point after the storm.\n\n4", "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1.

After the storm, the Skipper discovered he was only one-third of the way to his destination, which means he was 1/3 of 1200 km away from his starting point. This distance is equal to 400 km.\n\n4.  Since the Skipper sailed 600 km east, he was 600 km away from his starting point before the storm. After the storm, he was 400 km away. This means he was blown 600 - 400 = 200 km west by the storm.\n\nAnswer: 200", "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The Skipper sailed the ship halfway to the destination, so he covered half of the total distance. Let's call the total distance \"D\". The distance covered in the first 20 hours is D/2.\n\n2. The speed of the ship is 30 kilometers per hour, so in 20 hours, the distance covered is 30 * 20 = 600 kilometers.\n\n3. Since the distance covered is D/2, we can equate it to 600: D/2 = 600. Solving for D, we get D = 1200.\n\n4. The Skipper was blown backward by the storm to a point where he was only one-third of the way to his destination.

We are also given that Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. Since the full briefcase weighs 8 pounds and the weight of the laptop is the remaining weight after the papers are removed, the weight of the papers is 8 / 6 = 4/3 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the laptop is 8 - 4/3 = (24 - 4)/3 = 20/3 pounds.\n\n4.
