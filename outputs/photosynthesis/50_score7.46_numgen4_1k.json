The sunlight gives them the energy they need.\n2. **They absorb water from the ground** through their roots.\n3. **They take in carbon dioxide from the air** around them.\n4. **They use the energy from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make a sugar** that gives them energy.\n5. **As a byproduct of this process, they release oxygen into the air**.\n\nThis process is very important because it:\n\n* Gives plants the energy they need to grow.\n* Helps keep the air we breathe healthy by releasing oxygen.\n* Helps keep the Earth's atmosphere in balance.\n\nSo, photosynthesis is like a natural kitchen for plants, where they make their own food and help create a healthy environment for all living things.<|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|>", "Photosynthesis is the way plants make their own food.
