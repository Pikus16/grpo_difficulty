{"prompt": "Describe photosynthesis. Use as simple terms as possible", "outputs": ["Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and some other living things like algae and certain types of bacteria. It helps them make food from sunlight.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Plants spread out their leaves**: They have special parts called leaves that are like big solar panels, catching the sun's energy.\n\n2. **They absorb water and carbon dioxide**: The plants suck water from the ground and absorb a gas called carbon dioxide from the air.\n\n3. **They mix sunlight with water and carbon dioxide**: Using energy from the sun, the plants mix the water and carbon dioxide together.\n\n4. **They produce glucose and oxygen**: As a result of this mixing, the plants produce a type of sugar called glucose, which gives them energy, and also oxygen, which they release into the air.\n\n5. **They use glucose for energy**: The plants use the glucose to grow and live.\n\nSo, in simple terms, photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and air.

This is what we humans and other animals need to breathe to stay alive.\n\nIn short, photosynthesis is like a magical process that helps plants make food and oxygen at the same time.<|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|>", "Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food.
