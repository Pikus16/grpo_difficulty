It's like a magic power that helps them grow and thrive.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nPhotosynthesis helps plants make their own food from sunlight, water, and air. They use energy from the sun to turn water (H2O) and a gas called carbon dioxide (CO2) into a type of sugar that gives them energy.\n\n**The simple equation:**\n\nSunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide = Sugar + Oxygen\n\n**How does it work?**\n\n1. Plants spread out their leaves to catch the sunlight.\n2. They absorb water from the ground through their roots.\n3. They take in carbon dioxide from the air through tiny holes on their leaves.\n4. They use energy from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen.\n5. The sugar gives them energy to grow and live.\n6. The oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct.\n\n**Why is photosynthesis important?**\n\nPhotosynthesis is essential for life on Earth. It provides:\n\n1.
